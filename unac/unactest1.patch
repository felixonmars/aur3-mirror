-      January 27, 2000
-      Catalog-1.02 
-        is available. 
-      
-       The dmoz loading process has been dramatically simplified. It is
-          now only available as a command. No more fancy web interface that
-	  confuses everyone. In addition the convert_dmoz script now generates
-	  text files that can be directly loaded into Catalog instead of the
-	  intermediate XML file. The whole loading process now takes from 
-	  one to two hours depending on your machine. It took around 10 hours
-	  with the previous version. 
-       The -exclude option was added to convert_dmoz to get rid of 
-          a whole branch of the catalog at load time. Typical usage would
-	  be convert_dmoz -exclude '^/Adult' -what content content.rdf.gz.
-       A lot more sanity checks and repair have been added to deal with
-          duplicates, category id conflicts and the like.
-       Hopefully this new method will also be more understandable and 
-          generate less traffic on the mailing list. There is room for 
-	  improvements and contributors are welcome. 
-      
-      A new set of software is available in the 
-      download directory under the RedHat-6.1 section. These
-      are the most up to date versions on which Catalog depends. Although the
-      binaries depend on RedHat-6.1 the perl modules are source and can be
-      used on any platform.
-      
-      September 7, 1999
-      Catalog-1.01 
-        is available. 
-      This is a maintainance release.
-      
-        Various bug fixes. All easy
-	  to fix bugs have been fixed. Take a look at Bug Track to see what hasn't been fixed.
-        The _PATHTEXT_ and _PATHFILE_ 
-	  tags syntax has been extended to specify a range of path component.
-          
-        Graham Barr added a recursive
-	  template feature for a catalog root page. This allows to show sub-categories
-	  of the root categories in the root page of a catalog.
-          
-      
-      Don't hesitate to submit bugs
-        or ideas to bug track. Hopefully the next version of Catalog will have
-	a fast full text indexing mechanism and I'll be able to implement new
-	functionalities.
-        
-      Have fun !
-      July 3, 1999
-      Catalog-1.00 
-        is available. 
-      This release includes PHP3 
-        code to display a catalog. The author is Weston Bustraan (weston@infinityteldata.net). 
-        The main motivation to jump directly to version 1.00 is to avoid version 
-        number problems on CPAN. 
-      July 2, 1999
-      Catalog-0.19 
-        is available. 
-      This is a minor release. The 
-        most noticeable addition is the new search mechanism.
-      
-        Searching : two search modes 
-          are now available. AltaVista simple syntax and AltaVista advanced syntax. 
-          Both use the Text-Query and Text-Query-SQL perl modules. 
-        Dmoz loading is much more 
-          fault tolerant. In addition it can handle compressed versions of content.rdf 
-          and structure.rdf. The comments are now stored in text fields instead 
-          of char(255).
-        The template system was 
-          extended with the pre_fill and post_fill parameters.
-        Searching associated to 
-          a catalog dumped to static pages is now possible using the 'static' 
-          mode.
-        Fixed two security weakness 
-          in confedit and recursive cgi handling.
-        Many sql queries have been 
-          optimized.
-        The configuration was changed 
-          a bit to fix bugs and to isolate database dependencies.
-        The tests were updated to 
-          isolate database dependencies. 
-        Fixed numerous minor bugs, 
-          check ChangeLog if you're interested in details.
-      
-      Many thanks to Tim Bunce for 
-        his numerous contributions and ideas. He is the architect of the Text-Query 
-        and Text-Query-SQL modules, Eric Bohlman and Loic Dachary did the programming. 
-        
-      Thanks to Eric Bohlman for 
-        his help on the Text-Query module. He was very busy but managed to spend 
-        the time needed to release it. 
-      There is not yet anything usable 
-        for full text indexing but we keep working on it. The storage management 
-        is now handled by the reiserfs file system thanks to Hans Reiser who is 
-        working full time on this. Loic Dachary does his best to get something 
-        working, if you're interested go to http://www.senga.org/mifluz/. 
-      For some mysterious reason 
-        CPAN lost track of Catalog name. In order to install catalog you should 
-        use perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalog::db'. Weird but temporary.
-      Have fun !

+      Catalog-1.02 \
+        is available. \
+      \
+       The dmoz loading process has been dramatically simplified. It is\
+          now only available as a command. No more fancy web interface that\
+	  confuses everyone. In addition the convert_dmoz script now generates\
+	  text files that can be directly loaded into Catalog instead of the\
+	  intermediate XML file. The whole loading process now takes from \
+	  one to two hours depending on your machine. It took around 10 hours\
+	  with the previous version. \
+       The -exclude option was added to convert_dmoz to get rid of \
+          a whole branch of the catalog at load time. Typical usage would\
+	  be convert_dmoz -exclude '^/Adult' -what content content.rdf.gz.\
+       A lot more sanity checks and repair have been added to deal with\
+          duplicates, category id conflicts and the like.\
+       Hopefully this new method will also be more understandable and \
+          generate less traffic on the mailing list. There is room for \
+	  improvements and contributors are welcome. \
+      \
+      A new set of software is available in the \
+      download directory under the RedHat-6.1 section. These\
+      are the most up to date versions on which Catalog depends. Although the\
+      binaries depend on RedHat-6.1 the perl modules are source and can be\
+      used on any platform.\
+      \
+      September 7, 1999\
+      Catalog-1.01 \
+        is available. \
+      This is a maintainance release.\
+      \
+        Various bug fixes. All easy\
+	  to fix bugs have been fixed. Take a look at Bug Track to see what hasn't been fixed.\
+        The _PATHTEXT_ and _PATHFILE_ \
+	  tags syntax has been extended to specify a range of path component.\
+          \
+        Graham Barr added a recursive\
+	  template feature for a catalog root page. This allows to show sub-categories\
+	  of the root categories in the root page of a catalog.\
+          \
+      \
+      Don't hesitate to submit bugs\
+        or ideas to bug track. Hopefully the next version of Catalog will have\
+	a fast full text indexing mechanism and I'll be able to implement new\
+	functionalities.\
+        \
+      Have fun !\
+      July 3, 1999\
+      Catalog-1.00 \
+        is available. \
+      This release includes PHP3 \
+        code to display a catalog. The author is Weston Bustraan (weston@infinityteldata.net). \
+        The main motivation to jump directly to version 1.00 is to avoid version \
+        number problems on CPAN. \
+      July 2, 1999\
+      Catalog-0.19 \
+        is available. \
+      This is a minor release. The \
+        most noticeable addition is the new search mechanism.\
+      \
+        Searching : two search modes \
+          are now available. AltaVista simple syntax and AltaVista advanced syntax. \
+          Both use the Text-Query and Text-Query-SQL perl modules. \
+        Dmoz loading is much more \
+          fault tolerant. In addition it can handle compressed versions of content.rdf \
+          and structure.rdf. The comments are now stored in text fields instead \
+          of char(255).\
+        The template system was \
+          extended with the pre_fill and post_fill parameters.\
+        Searching associated to \
+          a catalog dumped to static pages is now possible using the 'static' \
+          mode.\
+        Fixed two security weakness \
+          in confedit and recursive cgi handling.\
+        Many sql queries have been \
+          optimized.\
+        The configuration was changed \
+          a bit to fix bugs and to isolate database dependencies.\
+        The tests were updated to \
+          isolate database dependencies. \
+        Fixed numerous minor bugs, \
+          check ChangeLog if you're interested in details.\
+      \
+      Many thanks to Tim Bunce for \
+        his numerous contributions and ideas. He is the architect of the Text-Query \
+        and Text-Query-SQL modules, Eric Bohlman and Loic Dachary did the programming. \
+        \
+      Thanks to Eric Bohlman for \
+        his help on the Text-Query module. He was very busy but managed to spend \
+        the time needed to release it. \
+      There is not yet anything usable \
+        for full text indexing but we keep working on it. The storage management \
+        is now handled by the reiserfs file system thanks to Hans Reiser who is \
+        working full time on this. Loic Dachary does his best to get something \
+        working, if you're interested go to http://www.senga.org/mifluz/. \
+      For some mysterious reason \
+        CPAN lost track of Catalog name. In order to install catalog you should \
+        use perl -MCPAN -e 'install Catalog::db'. Weird but temporary.\
+      Have fun !\
