############################## NOTES FOR THE USER ##############################
# CRON. To run this utility as a cronjob, either symlink it as root by invoking
# "ln -sf /usr/sbin/hostsblock /etc/cron.weekly/hostsblock" (or change
# "cron.weekly" to the appropriate time period) or use "crontab -e" to have cron
# manually run the program. Make sure to run this utility yourself first to make
# sure it operates properly.
#
# DNSMASQ. It is suggested that users make use of a dns caching daemon like
# dnsmasq. See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dnsmasq#DNS_Cache_Setup for
# directions. The default settings assume that you will be using dnsmasq. Make
# sure you add "addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.block" in dnsmasq, where /etc/hosts.block
# is your final hosts file (see the "hostsfile" variable).
#
# IF NOT USING DNSMASQ. If you decide not to use a dns caching daemon like
# dnsmasq, you will have to use the default system hosts file /etc/hosts. Make
# sure to copy your original to /etc/hostsblock/hosts.head to include your
# original entries, e.g. local loopback. This file will also include commented
# out alternative settings for this scenario.

################################### SETTINGS ###################################
# USE COLOR. Make notifications appear in color.
USECOLOR="yes"

# WORK DIRECTORY. Temporary direct where interim files will be downloaded and
# unzipped. This directory will be deleted after hostsblock completes itself.
tmpdir="/dev/shm"

# FINAL HOSTSFILE. The final hosts file that combines together all downloaded
# blocklists. If not using a dns caching daemon like dnsmasq, this should be
# /etc/hosts. Include hosts file entries which you want to maintain in the
# "hostshead" entry, such as your loopback device (e.g. 127.0.0.1 localhosts)
hostsfile="/etc/hosts.block"
#hostsfile="/etc/hosts" # If not using a dns caching daemon

# REDIRECT URL. Url to which blocked hosts will be redirect, either 0.0.0.0 or
# 127.0.0.1. This replaces any entries to 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1
redirecturl="127.0.0.1"

# POSTPROCESSING SUBROUTINE. Commands to run after the new hostsfile has been
# created. Typically this will be a dns caching daemon such as dnsmasq. Make
# sure to configure this daemon to read your included hosts file. In dnsmasq,
# this would entail including a line in /etc/dnsmasq.conf such as the following:
# "addn-hosts=/etc/hosts.block", where /etc/hosts.block is your final hosts file
# (see the "hostsfile" variable).
postprocess(){                #
    /etc/rc.d/dnsmasq restart # For dnsmasq
}                             #
#postprocess(){ #
#    /bin/true  # If not using a dns caching daemon
#}              #

# HEAD FILE. File containing hosts file entries which you want at the beginning
# of the resultant hosts file, e.g. for loopback devices and IPV6 entries. Use
# your original /etc/hosts file here if you are writing your final blocklist to
# /etc/hosts so as to preserve your loopback devices. Give hostshead="0" to
# disable this feature.
hostshead="0"
#hostshead="/etc/hostsblock/hosts.head" # If not using dns caching.

# BLACKLISTED SUBDOMAINS. File containing specific subdomains to blacklist which
# may not be in the downloaded blacklists. Be sure to provide not just the
# domain, e.g. "google.com", but also the specific subdomain a la
# "adwords.google.com" without quotations.
blacklist="/etc/hostsblock/black.list"

# WHITELIST. File containing the specific subdomains to allow through that may
# be blocked by the downloaded blocklists. In this file, put a space in front of
# a string in order to let through that specific site (without quotations), e.g.
# " www.example.com" will unblock "http://www.example.com" but not
# "http://subdomain.example.com". Leave no space in front of the entry to
# unblock all subdomains that contain that string, e.g. ".dropbox.com" will let
# through "www.dropbox.com", "dl.www.dropbox.com", "foo.dropbox.com",
# "bar.dropbox.com", etc.
whitelist="/etc/hostsblock/white.list"

# BLOCKLISTS. List all blocklists to be downloaded as an array.Files may be
# either plaintext, zip, or 7z files. Hostsfiles will identify zip and 7z files
# by their file extension.
