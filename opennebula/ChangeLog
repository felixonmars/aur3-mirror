	* 3.2.1-1:
	Changed package version numbering scheme to use three digits instead of
	   two.
	New upstream release (3.2.1).
	The OpenNebula Watch bug has been fixed; removed patching instructions
	   from PKGBUILD.
	The PKGBUILD now automatically detects whether to pass the '-k' switch to
	   ./install.sh when installing/upgrading. This means that your OpenNebula
	   config files won't get overwritten when upgrading anymore.
	Removed a few commented installation steps because it is far better to
	   just make the PKGBUILD do the 'vanilla' install and allow the user to
	   tweak it as necessary.

	Significant improvements to /etc/rc.d/oned and the opennebula.install
	   script.
