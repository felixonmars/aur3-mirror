J.D.: That's a little insensitive.

J.D.: (narration) Mistake.

Dr. Cox: Yeah, it is...
J.D.: What about his subconscious?
Dr. Cox: (leaning down and whispering) Eisenhower... was a sissy.

Turk: Oh, come on, Carla, give me one good reason why you won't go out with me.
Carla: Well, you're a surgeon. So, you've got the god-complex, the cockiness, the whole "married to the job" thing. You're cute, but you're very, very aware of it. You have no idea what I'm like, so all of your feelings for me are coming from down there (points at his crotch). But most of all, I'm looking for the real thing and you're nothing but a little boy who's not used to being told "no." So there's a bunch of reasons. Pick your favorite. (walks off)

Dr. Cox: (To intern review board) I would like to make special mention of one intern, here. John Dorian. Smart kid, he's extremely competent, and his enthusiasm and his determination to always be better is something I see 24 hours a day. He cares. He cares too much. But he's definitely somebody you don't want to lose. (As he walk away) Now if you have any questions... Well, I could give a crap! I'm going home.

Dr. Cox: Why did I become a doctor? Well gosh, I guess it's because ever since I was a little boy I just wanted to help people. You know, I don't tell this story often, but I remember when I was seven years old, one time I found a bird that had fallen out of its nest, so I picked him up and I brought him home and I made him a house out of an empty shoebox and... oh my God! (breaks up laughing) I became a doctor for the same four reasons everybody does: chicks, money, power, and chicks. But, since HMOs have made it virtually impossible to make any real money, which directly affects the number of chicks that come sniffin' around, and don't ask me what tree they're barking up, 'cause they're sure as hell not pissing on mine, and as far as power goes, well: Here I am during my free time letting some thirteen-year-old psychology fellow who couldn't cut it in real medicine ask me questions about my personal life, so here's the inside scoop there, pumpkin, why don't you go ahead and tell me all about power.

Dr. Cox: Relationships don't work the way they do on television and in the movies. Will they? Won't they? And then they finally do, and they're happy forever. Gimme a break. Nine out of ten of them end because they weren't right for each other to begin with, and half of the ones who get married get divorced anyway, and I'm telling you right now, through all this stuff, I have not become a cynic, I haven't. Yes, I do happen to believe that love is mainly about pushing chocolate covered candies and, y'know, in some cultures, a chicken. You can call me a sucker, I don't care, because I do believe in it. Bottom line is: it's couples who are truly right for each other wade through the same crap as everybody else, but the big difference is they don't let it take them down. One of those two people will stand up and fight for that relationship every time. If it's right, and they're real lucky, one of them will say something.

Dr. Cox: Newbie, the only way you could be less productive right now is if you were in fact, the wall on which you're leaning against. Of course, then you'd be providing some jackass with a wall on which to lean against and reflect on what a jackass he truly is. I know, here it's a conundrum, but don't you worry about it. I'll tackle that one right upstairs (points to his head). In the meantime, you could at least pretend to be doing some work.

Dr. Cox: Secure a vehicle of some kind, car, balloon, tricycle. And transport your father from wherever he is to where you're going to be.
J.D.: I don't think you really get my dad. He's not really interested in my work. He's more like a buddy.

J.D.: The thing is I don't really need a buddy. What I need is a father.
Dr. Cox: Well, you definitely need something. Um, maybe a backbone. Or perhaps some testicles. At the very least, a pillow that you can carry around the hospital and cry your sad eyes out.

Or maybe because you aren't as good as you thought you were. Either way, when you hit that low point, you have a choice. You can either wallow in self-pity, or you can suck it up. It's your call.

Wow, you're probably the first couple that's ever done that ever. It can't be that you're just scared, is it? (to Elliot) And you! Y-you know what, let's just — let's just forget for one second, that a month ago you told me you couldn't be in a relationship with anyone, because, for me, it's actually fun to watch you sabotage a relationship from the outside, it really is.

J.D.: (to Dr. Cox) C'mon, man, it's our last week together! The J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station! You must have a metaphor you want to use. Hit me with it.
Dr. Cox: I suppose I could riff on a list of things I care as little about as our last week together. Let me see. Low-carb diets. The O.C. The U.N. Getting Punk'd. Danny Gans. The Latin Grammys. The real Grammys. Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much. The Yankees' payroll. All the red states. All the blue states. Every hybrid car. Every talk show host. Everything on the planet. Everything in the solar system. Everything-everything-everything-everything that exists, past, present and future, in all discovered and undiscovered dimensions. Oh... and Hugh Jackman! (leaves)
J.D.: Hugh Jackman is Wolverine! How dare he!

(Dr. Cox has just made Elliot Chief Resident, passing J.D. over; J.D. does not take the news well.)
Dr. Cox: Newbie, how you doing?
J.D.: (voiceover) OK, keep it together. It's "be a man" time. (out loud, barely holding together) No, it's fine. You went with your gut. Elliot's a great doctor. I do have three questions, though. (hysterically) Why do you hate me when I show you nothing but love, who's going to tell my mom, and what the hell am I supposed to do with ten thousand "John Dorian, Chief Resident" business cards!? (Falls to his knees, throwing business cards everywhere)
Dr. Cox: Yeah, Scarlet, you're chief resident too.
J.D.: Uh, what now?
Dr. Cox: Well, I figure with her being ridiculously book-smart to the point where she has almost no interpersonal skills, and you being warm and cuddly as an un-potty trained labradoodle, and about as useful in high-stress medical situations as an un-potty trained labradoodle, together, the two of you make one barely passable doctor...-slash-labradoodle.
J.D.: So wait, why didn't you just say that in the first place?
Dr. Cox: What, and miss your hall-of-fame hissy? Not on your life.

Molly Clock: I think, as a psychiatrist, I should be there when Ms. Myers' bandages get removed. I mean, the accident was traumatic enough, but with reconstructive facial surgey on top of that? In my professional opinion: yikes!
Dr. Cox: Well, if you are coming in, I might just go ahead and phone up my pool man and my architect so we populate the room with just as many useless people as possible.
Molly Clock: Great! My mom's in town, should I call her?

Doug: Mr. Studabaker, forty minutes into my first day.
Kelso: I've been a doctor for thirty years. What do you think?
Doug: On my third day there was Mr. Kirschner.
Todd: Jenny Roth about eight weeks ago. It was really tough, because she was hot.
Doug: Then later that third day... (his beeper goes off) Oh boy, that can't be good.
Dr. Cox: No, newbie, I've not killed. But I happen to be, as always, the exception that proves the rule. So right about now you gotta be asking yourself: do you think you're that good?
			-- My First Kill (4.04)

J.D.: (narration) Even though I was already an amazing doctor, when I became chief resident I decided to add a little something extra to my repertoire. A hook, if you will.
(J.D. approaches the bed of a female patient, holding a handheld tape recorder)
J.D.: (into recorder) Mrs. McCullum, forties. Moderately attractive, condition improving.
Mrs. McCullum: Did you just say I was moderately attractive?
J.D.: Excuse me, Mrs. McCullum. (into recorder) Patient's complaint of hearing loss was clearly just to get attention.

Dr. Cox: Let's break down the kid's support system, shall we? He's got me, an emotionally crippled narcissist, and he's got you, an emotionally crippled narcissist who is soaking in a tub of what by now has to be mostly your own urine.
Dan: I believe the ratio has shifted that way, yes.
Dr. Cox: And I have got to believe that the two of us, together—together, Dan—we can make it at least half-way to one legitimate adult.

Molly: Perry, no one's pure evil! I mean, yeah, some people have a hard outer shell, but inside, everybody has a creamy center.
Dr. Cox: There are plenty of people here on this particular planet who are hard on the outside and hard on the inside.
Molly: So they'd have more of a nougaty center?
Dr. Cox: Lady, people aren't chocolates. D'you know what they are mostly? Bastards. Bastard-coated bastards with a bastard filling. But I don't find them half as annoying as I find naive bubble-headed optimists who walk around vomiting sunshine.
Molly: (Rubs his stomach) I'm touching your creamy center!

Dr. Cox: Bob, do you realize what you did by giving Blondie that book?

Dr. Cox: Thanks to your little gesture, she actually believes that the earth is full of people who, deep down, are filled with kindness and caring!
Dr. Kelso: Well that's absurd. People are bastard-coated bastards with a bastard filling.

Molly: I'm sorry, I'm attracted to damaged, dysfunctional people and you're just too normal.
J.D.: (narration) Sometimes all it takes is a slammin' hottie to make you dig down deep and discover who you really are.
J.D.: My emotional journey began at five years old when I walked in on my parents having sex in a position my father would later playfully describe as "the jackhammer." I have a mentor that verbally abuses me every chance he gets and no matter how much I try I can't stop constantly narrating my own life.
J.D.: (narration) At that very moment I feared I had divulged too much.
J.D.: Molly, I'm narcissistic, I'm pessimistic, I'm obsessive, I'm insecure and I am so afraid of intimacy that every one of my relationships is a journey of self-sabotage that inevitably ends in a black vacuum of shattered expectations and despair.
Molly: Wow. (kisses J.D.)

Suffice to say that it turns out at first it's endearing to watch them bounce of the walls, but man, you take your eyes off them for one second and bam!

Dr. Kelso: Perry, I get the feeling something is bothering you.
Dr. Cox: Bob, people have a private life and a professional life, and usually those two hells are kept pretty separate. For instance, I don't know that much about your home life other than the fact that you treat your wife like a dog, your dog like a wife, and your son like an androgynous ne'er-do-well who drained your retirement nest egg to open up a yarn shop in Minneapolis.
Dr. Kelso: Harrison posted his first profit this quarter.
Dr. Cox: Aces. And I'm guessing that's because his significant other...
Dr. Kelso: Terence.
Dr. Cox: ...Terence, doesn't follow him around the shop all day telling him just exactly what color is "in" this season or showing all the other employees that he is not in fact the boss of his own life. You see, the woman is everywhere. She's there when I work out in the morning, when I work out in the car on the way to work, and when I work out when I get to work. I can't seem to get away from her. That used to be fine, when she just came by for five minutes every month or so to feed on my dignity, but now I'd honestly kill myself, Bob, if I weren't absolutely certain that Jordan would be waiting for me in the afterlife. You see, typical of her, she went ahead and signed us up for an eternal tandem bike ride all along the banks of the River Styx.

J.D.: You probably wondered why I didn't show up before, huh? I know you wanted me to, even though you'd never admit it. Normally I would kill to get into this apartment, and you'd try and keep me out... I say "try", because at your Super-Bowl party, which I was not invited to, I was lucky enough to be able to watch the second half from right over there. I was the bearded Dominoe's employee you invited in because I said I was a fan of Jerome Bettis, whoever the hell that is. Anyway, I tried to convince myself the reason I didn't come earlier was because of you coming into work drunk; but that's not it. I was scared. I guess after all this time I still think of you as like this superhero that'll help me out of any situation I'm in. I needed that. But that's my problem, you know, and I'll deal with that. I guess I came over here to tell you how proud of you I am. Not because you did the best you could for those patients; but because after twenty years of being a doctor, when things go badly you still take it this hard. And I gotta tell you man, I mean... that's the kind of doctor I want to be. (pours himself a drink)
J.D.: (narration) Maybe he just needed time to heal, or maybe he just needed to see how much everybody cared, but I'd like to believe it was because of me that he was finally able to say this:

But as for me, I know you think it was a big victory figuring out what was wrong with Robyn, but those moments are kind of like eating a piece of chocolate. I enjoy the satisfaction for about ten seconds, and then it's gone. See, the thing that sticks with me, is the look of anguish on a patients face when I give them crappy news. I hold on to that forever. You're a surgeon: you occasionally get to fix people, but I figure out whats wrong with someone and then most the time I can't do anything about it; I just wish them luck dealing with it, or try to keep them alive for a while longer. So, you wanna know if I'll always be a doctor? I'd have to say, I don't know. I'm a doctor now, I will be tomorrow, but I can tell you that, if I'm ever lucky enough to get married, to have some kids, to maybe not need the money...

J.D.: It is, Lucy. Well, that and showing up my third grade teacher, who said I'd never amount to anything. Eat it, Mrs. Nickerson! (voiceover) And rest in peace.

Denise: I'm sorry, white bread, I'm not really looking for a protegé slash suckup.
Lucy: Dr. Mahoney, I am not sucking up! If I were sucking up, I would tell you how much I like your shoes... which I do, by the way! They're mannish, but flirty, like, "Hey boys, come and watch me build a deck."

Ted: Dr. Cox, did you hear that I'm quitting?
Dr. Cox: I did, Ted, and I don't know how to pretend to care.
Ted: Understandable.
Dr. Kelso: Theodore, I always figured that someday we'd just find you dead in your office.
Ted: Yeah, that was the dream. But the Gooch and I are taking some time off and touring the country.
Gooch: We've written a song for every state.
Dr. Cox: I'm sure I'll hear all of them when I die and go to Hell.

Bouncer: Are you on the list?
J.D.: Yes, under "John Dorian", or "Dr. Dorian". Or maybe "Doctor Dizzle" or "J. Dizzle".
Bouncer: There's a "J. Dizzle" here.
Man: I'm J. Dizzle!
J.D.: Dammit!

Lucy: Doctor D, I can't believe you're leaving us! You're, like, the best teacher ever!
J.D.: Ah, Lucy, but you'll always carry a piece of me with you. I'll be here (touches her head) and I'll be here (touches her stomach).
Lucy: In my stomach?
J.D.: I would have touched your heart, but I did that once to another female student, and it resulted in having to watch a four-hour video called "Boundaries".

(Lucy is taking blood from J.D.)
Lucy: I don't know why I'm not getting this.
J.D.: I used to have a problem with the same thing. But then I realized that you just have to pretend that the needle is your friend. Be careful, though: I told that to a medical student once, and he became a heroin addict.

Lucy: (to Elliot) Morning, sunshine! You look rested! Oh, and making time for the paper, that must be nice. (drops the act) Later, you munch!
Elliot: Did she just call me a buttmunch?
Drew: Well, she didn't use the word "butt", though I can't think of any other prominent kind of munch, so... yeah, she called you a buttmunch. (cheerfully) I'm Drew, by the way!

Dr. Cox: And now, a boring announcement about a pointless tradition, brought to you by an aging figurehead with a failing liver and an over-active libido.
Dr. Kelso: Thank you, Perry, you anger-filled muscle-slut.

Dr. Kelso: Me, too. It kills me that we're friends now.

(The class is to be tested on dissecting a cadaver, who was once Lucy's patient, Ben)
Lucy: (narration) Anyway, my friend Ben was going to propel our group to the top of the class. I'm so moved, I just want to put those feelings into words. (out loud) Dr. Turk, I can't wait to slice up this old bastard's ticker!

J.D. (to Elliot) Hello, wife-face! Your shift is over, and I'm taking you on a baby-moon!
Elliot: What are you talking about?
J.D.: A baby-moon is a vacation that couples take just before your baby baby comes out of your special area. And the resort I found is amazing; they have horseback riding, and jet-skiing...
Elliot: Oh, do they also have any punching each other in the stomach contests? Because that's another thing I can't do.

Cole: Your mom doesn't like me very much, does she?
Lucy: (nervously chewing her hair) She's crazy about you!
Cole: See? You're lying! Babe, I can read you like the back of a DVD case. You chew on your hair when you lie, you adjust your bra when you're about to yell at me, and you get this far-off look in your eye when you're narrating in your head.
Lucy: (narration) Even though Cole and I were clicking...
Cole: There it is!
Lucy: (adjusting her bra) Stop noticing things I do!

(The class is in detention under suspicion of cheating)
Denise: I hope it was Drew. Then he'll get his butt thrown out of here.
Lucy: What did he do to you? Did he smack you around?
Denise: Worse. He told me he loved me. Who does that? Don't you see? He's trying to get me to trust him so he can let me down.
Lucy: Crazy idea: you could just say I love you back.
Denise: Yeah, but then if it doesn't work out, I'll have to kill him, go to jail, break out, and kill you for giving me that advice.
Lucy: I love how our friendship is based predominately on threats.

Drew: I just needed a moment of peace and quiet. The other students will.. not.. stop asking me questions.
Dr. Cox: Oh, puh-leeze! I have a hospital full of incompetents hammering me with stupid questions every second of every day.
Todd: Dr. Cox, your patient in three is septic. Antibiotics or vasopressors?
Dr. Cox: Antibiotics at first.
Drew: That wasn't so dumb.
Dr. Cox: Wait for it.
Todd: Oh, did you get my request for scrubs that hug a little closer to my wham-bam?
Dr. Cox: Thank you, Todd, for being the example to a point you don't understand.
Todd: You're welcome.

Turk: I'm about to punch you in the mouth!

Lucy: OK, I'm sure Ben could be a jerk. But you have to admit he was a great bowler; I found a picture of him bowling a 310 on August 12, 1979.
