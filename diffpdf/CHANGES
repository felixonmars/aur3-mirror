1.2.2

Tiny change in how command line arguments are handled. This should make
things work with both English and non-English locales on Windows.

1.2.1

Minor improvement with focus control for Previous and Next buttons.

Acknowledged Steven Lee for building Windows binaries and Dirk Loss for
building Mac OS X binaries in the About box.

1.2.0

Got rid of old text comparison mode.

Various small user interface improvements.

Fixed a subtle bug that meant the combine text highlighting setting
wasn't saved and restored correctly.

1.1.5

Slightly changed the .pro file to make it a tiny bit more helpful.
Added a Help button and separated Help and About information.
Updated the README for Mac users (thanks to Dirk Loss for the info).

1.1.4

Improved the reporting of files that are the same.

1.1.3

Tiny bugfix for Debian.

1.1.2

It is now possible for the user to control whether highlighting is
combined in text mode.

Added a cache for page images. This makes it much quicker to flick back
and forth between pages. The cache size can be set by the user: the
bigger the cache the more pages that can be flicked through without
recalculating.

1.1.1

Replaced QVariant::toReal() with QVariant::toDouble() to avoid breaking
compatibility with Qt 4.4.

1.1.0

Added margin rules to indicate where changes are. (These can be turned
off by setting a rule width of 0.0.)

1.0.0

Implemented the sequence matcher algorithm for text mode matching.

0.6.0

Redid the user interface to use dock widgets.

0.5.0

First release.
