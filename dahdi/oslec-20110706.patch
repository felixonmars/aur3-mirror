+/* Implementation Notes
+   David Rowe
+   April 2007
+
+   This code started life as Steve's NLMS algorithm with a tap
+   rotation algorithm to handle divergence during double talk.  I
+   added a Geigel Double Talk Detector (DTD) [2] and performed some
+   G168 tests.  However I had trouble meeting the G168 requirements,
+   especially for double talk - there were always cases where my DTD
+   failed, for example where near end speech was under the 6dB
+   threshold required for declaring double talk.
+
+   So I tried a two path algorithm [1], which has so far given better
+   results.  The original tap rotation/Geigel algorithm is available
+   in SVN http://svn.rowetel.com/software/oslec/tags/before_16bit.
+   It's probably possible to make it work if some one wants to put some
+   serious work into it.
+
+   At present no special treatment is provided for tones, which
+   generally cause NLMS algorithms to diverge.  Initial runs of a
+   subset of the G168 tests for tones (e.g ./echo_test 6) show the
+   current algorithm is passing OK, which is kind of surprising.  The
+   full set of tests needs to be performed to confirm this result.
+
+   One other interesting change is that I have managed to get the NLMS
+   code to work with 16 bit coefficients, rather than the original 32
+   bit coefficents.  This reduces the MIPs and storage required.
+   I evaulated the 16 bit port using g168_tests.sh and listening tests
+   on 4 real-world samples.
+
+   I also attempted the implementation of a block based NLMS update
+   [2] but although this passes g168_tests.sh it didn't converge well
+   on the real-world samples.  I have no idea why, perhaps a scaling
+   problem.  The block based code is also available in SVN
+   http://svn.rowetel.com/software/oslec/tags/before_16bit.  If this
+   code can be debugged, it will lead to further reduction in MIPS, as
+   the block update code maps nicely onto DSP instruction sets (it's a
+   dot product) compared to the current sample-by-sample update.
+
+   Steve also has some nice notes on echo cancellers in echo.h

+   IDEAS for further optimisation of lms_adapt_bg():

+   However this would lower potential optimisation of filter, as I
+   think the dual-MAC architecture requires packed 16 bit coeffs.
+
+   2/ Block based update would be more efficient, as per comments above,
+   could use dual MAC architecture.
+
+   3/ Look for same sample Blackfin LMS code, see if we can get dual-MAC
+   packing.
+
+   4/ Execute the whole e/c in a block of say 20ms rather than sample
+   by sample.  Processing a few samples every ms is inefficient.

+   Some soft phones send speech signals with a lot of low frequency
+   energy, e.g. down to 20Hz.  This can make the hybrid non-linear
+   which causes the echo canceller to fall over.  This filter can help

+   hybrid.
+
+   It can also help by removing and DC in the tx signal.  DC is bad

+
+   This is one of the classic DC removal filters, adjusted to provide

+   from things that upset them. The difference between successive samples
+   produces a lousy HPF, and then a suitably placed pole flattens things out.
+   The final result is a nicely rolled off bass end. The filtering is
+   implemented with extended fractional precision, which noise shapes things,

+Line echo cancellation for voice
+
+What does it do?
+
+This module aims to provide G.168-2002 compliant echo cancellation, to remove
+electrical echoes (e.g. from 2-4 wire hybrids) from voice calls.
+
+
+How does it work?
+
+The heart of the echo cancellor is FIR filter. This is adapted to match the
+echo impulse response of the telephone line. It must be long enough to
+adequately cover the duration of that impulse response. The signal transmitted
+to the telephone line is passed through the FIR filter. Once the FIR is
+properly adapted, the resulting output is an estimate of the echo signal
+received from the line. This is subtracted from the received signal. The result
+is an estimate of the signal which originated at the far end of the line, free
+from echos of our own transmitted signal.
+
+The least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is attributed to Widrow and Hoff, and
+was introduced in 1960. It is the commonest form of filter adaption used in
+things like modem line equalisers and line echo cancellers. There it works very
+well.  However, it only works well for signals of constant amplitude. It works
+very poorly for things like speech echo cancellation, where the signal level
+varies widely.  This is quite easy to fix. If the signal level is normalised -
+similar to applying AGC - LMS can work as well for a signal of varying
+amplitude as it does for a modem signal. This normalised least mean squares
+(NLMS) algorithm is the commonest one used for speech echo cancellation. Many
+other algorithms exist - e.g. RLS (essentially the same as Kalman filtering),
+FAP, etc. Some perform significantly better than NLMS.  However, factors such
+as computational complexity and patents favour the use of NLMS.
+
+A simple refinement to NLMS can improve its performance with speech. NLMS tends
+to adapt best to the strongest parts of a signal. If the signal is white noise,
+the NLMS algorithm works very well. However, speech has more low frequency than
+high frequency content. Pre-whitening (i.e. filtering the signal to flatten its
+spectrum) the echo signal improves the adapt rate for speech, and ensures the
+final residual signal is not heavily biased towards high frequencies. A very
+low complexity filter is adequate for this, so pre-whitening adds little to the
+compute requirements of the echo canceller.
+
+An FIR filter adapted using pre-whitened NLMS performs well, provided certain
+conditions are met:
+
+    - The transmitted signal has poor self-correlation.
+    - There is no signal being generated within the environment being
+      cancelled.
+
+The difficulty is that neither of these can be guaranteed.
+
+If the adaption is performed while transmitting noise (or something fairly
+noise like, such as voice) the adaption works very well. If the adaption is
+performed while transmitting something highly correlative (typically narrow
+band energy such as signalling tones or DTMF), the adaption can go seriously
+wrong. The reason is there is only one solution for the adaption on a near
+random signal - the impulse response of the line. For a repetitive signal,
+there are any number of solutions which converge the adaption, and nothing
+guides the adaption to choose the generalised one. Allowing an untrained
+canceller to converge on this kind of narrowband energy probably a good thing,
+since at least it cancels the tones. Allowing a well converged canceller to
+continue converging on such energy is just a way to ruin its generalised
+adaption. A narrowband detector is needed, so adapation can be suspended at
+appropriate times.
+
+The adaption process is based on trying to eliminate the received signal. When
+there is any signal from within the environment being cancelled it may upset
+the adaption process. Similarly, if the signal we are transmitting is small,
+noise may dominate and disturb the adaption process. If we can ensure that the
+adaption is only performed when we are transmitting a significant signal level,
+and the environment is not, things will be OK. Clearly, it is easy to tell when
+we are sending a significant signal. Telling, if the environment is generating
+a significant signal, and doing it with sufficient speed that the adaption will
+not have diverged too much more we stop it, is a little harder.
+
+The key problem in detecting when the environment is sourcing significant
+energy is that we must do this very quickly. Given a reasonably long sample of
+the received signal, there are a number of strategies which may be used to
+assess whether that signal contains a strong far end component. However, by the
+time that assessment is complete the far end signal will have already caused
+major mis-convergence in the adaption process. An assessment algorithm is
+needed which produces a fairly accurate result from a very short burst of far
+end energy.
+
+How do I use it?
+
+The echo cancellor processes both the transmit and receive streams sample by
+sample. The processing function is not declared inline. Unfortunately,
+cancellation requires many operations per sample, so the call overhead is only
+a minor burden.

+   Blackfin NOTES & IDEAS:
+
+   A simple dot product function is used to implement the filter.  This performs
+   just one MAC/cycle which is inefficient but was easy to implement as a first
+   pass.  The current Blackfin code also uses an unrolled form of the filter
+   history to avoid 0 length hardware loop issues.  This is wasteful of
+   memory.
+
+   Ideas for improvement:
+
+   1/ Rewrite filter for dual MAC inner loop.  The issue here is handling
+   history sample offsets that are 16 bit aligned - the dual MAC needs
+   32 bit aligmnent.  There are some good examples in libbfdsp.
+
+   2/ Use the hardware circular buffer facility tohalve memory usage.
+
+   3/ Consider using internal memory.
+
+   Using less memory might also improve speed as cache misses will be
+   reduced. A drop in MIPs and memory approaching 50% should be
+   possible.
+
+   The foreground and background filters currenlty use a total of
+   about 10 MIPs/ch as measured with speedtest.c on a 256 TAP echo
+   can.
