*jar file should be uploaded 
    - to cell phone, which is JSR-82 compatible or 
    - to cell phone with Java realization which allows access to IR port.
    - to Wi-Fi enabled phone (including WinMobile/Jbed devices)
    - to cell phone which can connect to anyremote through TCP/IP over GPRS

There are several variants of JAR file:

anyRemote-16.jar - contains only 16x16 icon set. Best variant for phones with 
                   160x160 screen or lower.
anyRemote-32.jar - contains 16x16 and 32x32 icon sets.

anyRemote-48.jar - contains 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 icon set. Best variant for phones 
		   with 240x320 screen.

anyRemote-64.jar - contains 16x16, 32x32 and 64x64 icon sets. Best variant for 
                   phones with screen higher than 240x320.

anyRemote-nojsr82.jar - contains 32x32 and 64x64 icon sets and 64x64 title icon. 
                   This version does not supports JSR-82 and can be used in 
		   WinMobile or Linux-based devices with Esmertec's Jbed installed.

The only difference between anyRemote-XX.jar's and anyRemote-XXb.jar's is the 
size of title icon (16 or 64)

In general, anyRemote-XXb.jar suggested to use on Nokia's, and anyRemote-XX.jar 
on all other cell phones.
