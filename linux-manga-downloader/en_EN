1- Normal
2- Bulk
The second one allows you to download a full manga just putting the url:

or if we want it from an specific fansub:
http://submanga.com/The_World_God_Only_Knows/scanlation/Nikasub"
###

GULA2="<b>1- 4chan</b> - For 4chan you have got to introduce the thread url ej: http://boards.4chan.org/h/res/3025102
(don't try to acced because the thread won't exist XD)
After introducing the url in the first block you got to introduce a name for the directory in the second block. If you don't do it, a random one will be applied

<b>2- Zerochan</b> - Put the url of the gallery you wish to download. ex: http://www.zerochan.net/Durarara%21%21?q=durarara, the first page for less problems ;)

<b>3- Boru</b> - This is for the pages made with Danboru, a debian CMS specific to image galleries, this plug is functional on many Danboru-made pages. If doen'st work on someone, say it and I'll try their compatibility
ex url: http://konachan.com/post/index?tags=angel_beats%21

<b>**Warning: Danboru are famous because of the so great ammount of hentai, even though they use to have very good wallpapers**</b>

<b>4- Pown-it</b> - Super repetitive and addictive flashes
ex url: http://www.pown.it/5224"
