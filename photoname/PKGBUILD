The sort-of easy fix is:

   Install cabal-dev-git from the AUR first

But.. what I myself do instead:

   Get cabal-dev from github and build it with cabal, with --user,
   and then make sure the resulting cabal-dev binary is on the PATH.

What does this really mean? Read on..

The goal of installing this package is not to have its build deps
installed on your system, it's to have its binaries. To that end,
I chose to build it with cabal-dev which will build in a sandboxed
environment.

I don't want to make a decision as to the right way for you to get
cabal-dev installed on your system, so that's why we're here. You
need cabal-dev installed and I couldn't find one.

Also, cabal-dev-git is patched to build against the current ghc
that Arch has, so we're preferring that over cabal-dev in the AUR.
