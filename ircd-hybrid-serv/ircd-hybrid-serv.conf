A:System Operator <root@localhost.localdomain>

# The first field is the name you want the services server to be.  It
# should match the C/N lines of the hub server.  The second field is
# the text info for the services (it corresponds to the third field
# in a server's M line)

N:localhost.localdomain:Hybrid services

# This line should contain three fields. In order, the password for
# the connection, the hostname (or IP address) of the hub server to
# connect to, and the port to connect at. If no port is specified,
# DefaultHubPort, specified in settings.conf, is used.  You may put
# as many S: lines as you wish. If services cannot connect to the
# first server, or gets disconnected, it will move onto the next one
# and so on.
# (The password must match the C/N lines of the hub server).

S:changeme:127.0.0.1:6667

# V: lines specify a virtual hostname to bind to when connecting to
# a remote site. IP Addresses can be used as well. If multiple V:
# lines are given, only the first is used

V:127.0.0.1

# O: lines specify users who will have access to Hybserv.  The first
# field should contain the user's username@host.  The second should
# be a password that the user will be required to register with in 
# order to use services.  The third field is the nickname of the user
# (ie: the nickname that will appear in the partyline)  Finally, the
# fourth field is a list of flags the user will have, entitling them
# to different privileges.  All four fields must be given, or Hybserv
# will not consider the line valid. Read the file doc/README-FLAGS
# for full descriptions on each type of flag available.
# ** NOTE: All passwords should be encrypted if CRYPT_OPER_PASSWORDS
#          is defined in config.h (which is the default) - use

# The last field has no effect if ADVFLOOD_GLINE was not
