The Electronic Dictionary Research and Development Group, then at
at Monash University (hereafter "the Group"), on the understanding that 
the Group
will foster the development of the dictionary files, and will utilize all
monies received for use of the files for the further
development of the files, and for research into computer lexicography and
electronic dictionaries.

<p align="JUSTIFY">
For attribution of these files, you must:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">in the case of publishing significant extracts of the files, or
material based on significant extracts of the files, e.g. in a published
dictionary or in

<ol type="i">
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">acknowledge the usage and source of the files in the documentation,
publicity material, WWW site of the package/server, etc.;
</p>
</li>
<li><p align="JUSTIFY">provide copies of the documentation and licence files (in the case

display of words from the files, the acknowledgement must be made on each
screen display, e.g. in the form of a message at the foot of the screen
or page. If, however, material from the files is mixed with information from
other sources, it is sufficient to provide a general acknowledgement of the
sources as described above.
