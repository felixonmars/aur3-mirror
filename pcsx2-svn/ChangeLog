	* makedepends() :
	Renamed 'google-sparsehash' as 'sparsehash'
	
	* build() :
	Add fix for new include dir (changed from /usr/include/google/sparsehash/*
	to /usr/include/sparsehash/* without correct backward compatibility).
	Used 'sed' for this fix, so won't impact this auto-update package if PCSX2
	upstream fix on their source code.

	* 5015-1 :
	Updated to latest upstream revision
	
	* depends :
	Moved {lib32-}gtk-engines from optdepends to depends, so user will
	always have a slightly better graphic interface experience.
	
	* package() :
	Fixed man page name format. Upstream delivers it in a file name that
	would result in wrong man page name in the package: pcsx2.man.gz. So,
	it is being rename to result in pcsx2.1.gz - which is correct.
	
	User configurations and preferences folder changed from $HOME/PCSX2 to
	$HOME/.config/PCSX2, to follow XGD Standards. User must move the memory
	cards, BIOS files, savegames, etc. to this new folder.
