echo "Pbtorrent is a script to browse/search the pirate bay from the command line. When torrents are picked the torrent file will be copied to a watch directoy, to be picked up by a torrent client, that automatically loads torrents in that directory (please edit the script to set the corrent 'watchdir' variable).

The syntax is fast-typed but somewhat inflexible (the order of apperance must be respected):

pbtorrent [search category key] ([sorting key]) ([search terms])

First, a (one and only one) search category is required. The options are:
   a	audio
   v	video
   s	software
   g	games
   x	anything else
   A	all of the above (requires search terms to work)

Second, a sorting key is optional (if none is entered, number of seeds is default). The options are:
   s	seeds
   z	size
   r	relevance (pirate bay default)

Finally you enter your search terms. If none are entered, you will be given the 'browse category' results.

Examples                        Meaning
pbtorrent a                     Browse category audio with default (seeds) sorting key
pbtorrent s r ubuntu            Search software category for 'ubuntu' with relevance sorting key
pbtorrent v z                   Browse video category with size sorting key
pbtorrent x surprise me         Search anything else category for term 'surprise me' with default sorting

Your search results will be presented in table format with a number, a name, size (caveat: you have to guess if it means kiB, MiB or GiB - sucks, i know, but it saves a lot of trouble, and it's not that hard to figure out), number of seeds and number of leeches. Just enter the number(s) of the torrent(s) you want (multiple numbers should be separated by a space) and hit enter, and the torrent will be downloaded and fed to transmission. In order to be able to keep browsing your results (say you're looking at the first page of the most popular video files, 'pbtorrent v', and want to see what's on the following page(s) too), the script will only exit when 'q' or 'x' is entered."  | fmt -s -w $twidth
