        * 1.6-1 :
	Don't give eject choice for mounted optical disks
	they must be unmounted before ejection is possible)

	usage: udisksvm [-h] [-v] [-n] [-d] traydconf
	Added command lines options:
	   positional arguments:
	     traydconf      configuration file for traydevice
	                    default: /usr/share/udisksvm/udisksvm.xml

	It has no configuration file and a predefined simple popup menu
	with only 'Mount', 'Unmount' and 'Eject' actions
	It is the last stage before migrating to UDisks2
