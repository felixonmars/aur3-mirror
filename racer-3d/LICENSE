Publishing of material downloadable here may however be done on a non-commericial basis. In this case, I would appreciate it if you send me a note regarding where you make available the material.

Use of any of the published source code in commercial software is explicilty NOT allowed without prior written permission. Distributions on Linux distributions (as is done on SuSE8.0 for example) IS however allowed. Use of (parts of) the source code in non-commercial software is allowed however. For commercial usage, licensing may be an option, for which you can contact the author.

This is NOT an Open Source project, although many people think so. You CAN contribute to the source if you want (or cannot resist), but all changes will go through me to the master source code. This is done to ensure quality and consistent style for instance. Also, parts of Racer (the QLib/D3 libraries) are used in other projects, and changing the source code of this would be counterproductive for the other products that use these libraries. Therefore, the decision has been made not to OpenSource the source code.
Realise that the copyrights will stay at Dolphinity, so for many people this will mean that they won't contribute to the source. This is ok to me, the product seems not large enough to need the whole world to aid in developing (except for the contents; cars & tracks). To add to the Racer project and maintain control, it is advised to create separate executables, which may use parts of the source code, but are not completely separately usable products. This means you can create a Replay Analyzer which uses track code from the Racer source code, but that you may NOT create a complete racing game based on a specific era for example, and distribute this commercially as a separate product.

If you have any questions on the usage of the materials presented in the Racer site, please contact me.
