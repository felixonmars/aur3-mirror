#
# Information for advanced users: The diagnostic page embeds the plugin
# of type "application/x-pipelight-error" to trigger the output of some
# debug information. The plugin cannot be triggered if everything is
# working, so this only affects users with a broken installation.
# The debug output will include paths on the local filesystem and the
# linux distribution used. If you don't want to leak this information
# accidentially in case of a broken installation please either uninstall
# Pipelight or disable the diagnosticMode. [default: false]

# In order to support browsers without NPAPI timer support
# (like Midori) we've implemented a fallback to
# NPN_PluginThreadAsyncCall. In the default configuration 
# a timer based approach is preferred over async calls and the
# plugin decides by itself which method to use depending on the
# browser capabilities. Setting the following option to true
# forces the plugin to use async calls. This might be mainly
# useful for testing the difference between both event handling
# approaches. [default: false]
#
# eventAsyncCall    = true

#
# The opera browser claims to provide timer functions, but they

# We are currently implementing hardware acceleration support, which
# can cause problems on some systems as especially specific open source
# drivers render only garbage when hardware acceleration is enabled.
# To prevent breaking any working solutions, we are currently
# implementing a whitelist system, which will enable hardware
# acceleration by default if the specified shell scripts returns 0.
# Otherwise we will disable it. You can still use

# overwriteArg      = enableGPUAcceleration=false/true

#
# Silverlight uses a lot of timer stuff do to the window redrawing
# . In order to speed this up a bit the following switch enables
# some API hooks to do most of timer stuff in user mode (without
# having to call wine-server each time). It is still unclear
# if this option has any significant effent on the performance.
