#
# Information for advanced users: The diagnostic page embeds the plugin
# of type "application/x-pipelight-error" to trigger the output of some
# debug information. The plugin cannot be triggered if everything is
# working, so this only affects users with a broken installation.
# The debug output will include paths on the local filesystem and the
# linux distribution used. If you don't want to leak this information
# accidentially in case of a broken installation please either uninstall
# Pipelight or disable the diagnosticMode. [default: false]

# Silverlight uses a lot of timer stuff do to the window redrawing
# . In order to speed this up a bit the following switch enables

# if this option has any significant effect on the performance.
