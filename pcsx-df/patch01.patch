-Notes on the Free Translation Project
-*************************************
-
-   Free software is going international!  The Free Translation Project
-is a way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all
-together, so that will gradually become able to speak many languages.
-A few packages already provide translations for their messages.
-
-   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may
-assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,
-itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_
-need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using
-this package with messages translated.
-
-   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
-explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
-available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
-work at translations should contact the appropriate team.
-
-   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
-related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
-`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
-`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.
-
-Quick configuration advice
-==========================
-
-   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
-should configure it using
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
-package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the
-operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only
-the `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as
-many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
-charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
-It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
-of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
-very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
-to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.
-
-   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or
-you have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the
-included `libintl'.
-
-INSTALL Matters
-===============
-
-   Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the
-programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
-Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
-ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.
-
-   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
-messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already
-provides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the GNU `gettext' own
-library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
-package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
-the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.  Installers may use
-special options at configuration time for changing the default
-behaviour.  The commands:
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-     ./configure --disable-nls
-
-will respectively bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the
-internationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,
-_totally_ disable translation of messages.
-
-   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
-configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
-probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
-will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
-should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
-if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
-package is more recent, you should use
-
-     ./configure --with-included-gettext
-
-to prevent auto-detection.
-
-   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
-and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
-emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
-extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.
-
-   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
-LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
-translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
-`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
-together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
-may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
-`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
-codes, stating which languages are allowed.
-
-Using This Package
-==================
-
-   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
-only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
-`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
-and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
-suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
-prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
-`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
-This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
-all.
-
-   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
-But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
-example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
-country code serves to distinguish the dialects.
-
-   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
-language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
-on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
-used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
-locales supported by your system for your country by running the command
-`locale -a | grep '^LL''.
-
-   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
-English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
-understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
-This is done through a different environment variable, called
-`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
-for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
-set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
-system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
-read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
-available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.
-
-   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
-environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
-to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
-to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
-(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.
-
-Translating Teams
-=================
-
-   For the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
-people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
-able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
-Each translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of
-teams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,
-`http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/', in the "National teams"
-area.
-
-   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you
-should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
-The subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has
-`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
-message to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:
-
-     subscribe
-
-   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
-_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
-rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
-you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
-get started, please write to `translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to reach the
-coordinator for all translator teams.
-
-   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
-the terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more than
-programming skill, here.
-
-Available Packages
-==================
-
-   Languages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following
-matrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2003.
-The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO
-files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a
-translation percentage of at least 50%.

-   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
-visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
-used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
-dialects.
-
-   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
-which it applies should also have been internationalized and
-distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
-lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
-distribution.
-
-   If May 2003 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of
-this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most up-to-date
-matrix with full percentage details can be found at
-`http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/matrix.html'.
-
-Using `gettext' in new packages
-===============================
-
-   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
-internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
-package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
-License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
-in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
-library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
-library or use modified versions of `libintl'.
-
-   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
-the use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
-Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
-developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
-applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
-`translation@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
-the translation teams.

+PCSX-df uses gettext internally, but can be configured without it.
+The gettext library is not included with PCSX-df.

-# For projects using AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR([foo]), Autoconf sets
-# $ac_aux_dir to `$srcdir/foo'.  In other projects, it is set to
-# `$srcdir', `$srcdir/..', or `$srcdir/../..'.
-#
-# Of course, Automake must honor this variable whenever it calls a
-# tool from the auxiliary directory.  The problem is that $srcdir (and
-# therefore $ac_aux_dir as well) can be either absolute or relative,
-# depending on how configure is run.  This is pretty annoying, since
-# it makes $ac_aux_dir quite unusable in subdirectories: in the top
-# source directory, any form will work fine, but in subdirectories a
-# relative path needs to be adjusted first.
-#
-# $ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory if $ac_aux_dir is relative
-# $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing
-#    fails if $ac_aux_dir is absolute,
-#    fails when called from a subdirectory in a VPATH build with
-#          a relative $ac_aux_dir
-#
-# The reason of the latter failure is that $top_srcdir and $ac_aux_dir
-# are both prefixed by $srcdir.  In an in-source build this is usually
-# harmless because $srcdir is `.', but things will broke when you
-# start a VPATH build or use an absolute $srcdir.
-#
-# So we could use something similar to $top_srcdir/$ac_aux_dir/missing,
-# iff we strip the leading $srcdir from $ac_aux_dir.  That would be:
-#   am_aux_dir='\$(top_srcdir)/'`expr "$ac_aux_dir" : "$srcdir//*\(.*\)"`
-# and then we would define $MISSING as
-#   MISSING="\${SHELL} $am_aux_dir/missing"
-# This will work as long as MISSING is not called from configure, because
-# unfortunately $(top_srcdir) has no meaning in configure.
-# However there are other variables, like CC, which are often used in
-# configure, and could therefore not use this "fixed" $ac_aux_dir.
-#
-# Another solution, used here, is to always expand $ac_aux_dir to an
-# absolute PATH.  The drawback is that using absolute paths prevent a
-# configured tree to be moved without reconfiguration.

-/* Thanks to Mike Haertel and Jim Avera for this test.
-   Here is a matrix of mmap possibilities:
-	mmap private not fixed
-	mmap private fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
-	mmap private fixed at somewhere already mapped
-	mmap shared not fixed
-	mmap shared fixed at somewhere currently unmapped
-	mmap shared fixed at somewhere already mapped
-   For private mappings, we should verify that changes cannot be read()
-   back from the file, nor mmap's back from the file at a different
-   address.  (There have been systems where private was not correctly
-   implemented like the infamous i386 svr4.0, and systems where the
-   VM page cache was not coherent with the file system buffer cache
-   like early versions of FreeBSD and possibly contemporary NetBSD.)
-   For shared mappings, we should conversely verify that changes get
-   propagated back to all the places they're supposed to be.
-
-   Grep wants private fixed already mapped.
-   The main things grep needs to know about mmap are:
-   * does it exist and is it safe to write into the mmap'd area
-   * how to use it (BSD variants)  */

-This is the AMD64 dynamic recompiler.
-Made from opcodes from PCSX2 0.9.3 and the x86 recompiler modified to fit.  ie. currently no AMD64/SSE specific code advantages.
-
-Note that this recompiler currently requires all variables, data heaps, function pointers, etc to be within a 4 Gig range of each other.  While this is currently the case through luck and dirty hacks, a proper fix should be implemented.

-dnl Macro to add for using GNU gettext.
-
-dnl Usage: AM_GNU_GETTEXT([INTLSYMBOL], [NEEDSYMBOL], [INTLDIR]).
-dnl INTLSYMBOL can be one of 'external', 'no-libtool', 'use-libtool'. The
-dnl    default (if it is not specified or empty) is 'no-libtool'.
-dnl    INTLSYMBOL should be 'external' for packages with no intl directory,
-dnl    and 'no-libtool' or 'use-libtool' for packages with an intl directory.
-dnl    If INTLSYMBOL is 'use-libtool', then a libtool library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.la will be created (shared and/or static,
-dnl    depending on --{enable,disable}-{shared,static} and on the presence of
-dnl    AM-DISABLE-SHARED). If INTLSYMBOL is 'no-libtool', a static library
-dnl    $(top_builddir)/intl/libintl.a will be created.
-dnl If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is 'need-ngettext', then GNU gettext
-dnl    implementations (in libc or libintl) without the ngettext() function
-dnl    will be ignored.  If NEEDSYMBOL is specified and is
-dnl    'need-formatstring-macros', then GNU gettext implementations that don't
-dnl    support the ISO C 99 <inttypes.h> formatstring macros will be ignored.
-dnl INTLDIR is used to find the intl libraries.  If empty,
-dnl    the value `$(top_builddir)/intl/' is used.
-dnl
-dnl The result of the configuration is one of three cases:
-dnl 1) GNU gettext, as included in the intl subdirectory, will be compiled
-dnl    and used.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 2) GNU gettext has been found in the system's C library.
-dnl    Catalog format: GNU --> install in $(datadir)
-dnl    Catalog extension: .mo after installation, .gmo in source tree
-dnl 3) No internationalization, always use English msgid.
-dnl    Catalog format: none
-dnl    Catalog extension: none
-dnl If INTLSYMBOL is 'external', only cases 2 and 3 can occur.
-dnl The use of .gmo is historical (it was needed to avoid overwriting the
-dnl GNU format catalogs when building on a platform with an X/Open gettext),
-dnl but we keep it in order not to force irrelevant filename changes on the
-dnl maintainers.

+- there was a bug that was preventing the config window from ever returning - it would disappear but never close.  i say *was* cause it's fixed =)
+- use the "Enable subchannel option" to turn on/off subchannel data reading.  some games work better with it off rather than on.
+- upgraded PortAudio to version 0.18.1 (for CD-DA audio)
+- added an experimental caching option.  it's pretty much just a huge LRU cache for previously read data from the image.  try it and see if you like it.
+- other random fixes...  i dont quite remember them all =)
+
+
+yeah, yeah... 2.7
+
+- fixed a bug that was causing games without a track listing file (.cue, .ccd) to crash with the error "read past end of disc".  just a lesson to keep those files when you're making your disc images =)
+- the rar library is now using assembly optimized code.
+- fixed (yet another) off by one problem, this time in the internally generated subchannel data.
+- found a bug where if it seeked to the end of disk, sometimes it would get stuck there... oops

+- the total cd length was returning 0:0:0.. oops =) i doubt this affects any compatability, but it's nice to have it fixed.
+- by request, added a config option to alter the autorun settings.  autorun images are now persistent until changed or cleared with the config settings or manually.  this lets you use autorun with epsxecutor and other frontends.
+
+
+CDRMooby 2.5
+
+sorry for the lack of communication folks, been on a hiatus of sorts lately...  and sorry about 2.4 which ended up causing more problems than it fixed.  anyway, here's the scoop on the latest stuff:
+
+- Fixed an off-by-one-frame subchannel problem that was causing XA playback to stop in certain games.  Big thanks to the Peops CDR freely available source code for helping me find this one =)
+- Fixed some mishandled pregap data that was messing with CDDA timing.
+- Previously, only SUB subchannel files could be used because the plugin would fail to find any of the other subchannel file types.
+- Linked with FLTK 1.1.3
+
+
+CDRMooby 2.4
+
+I think this is fixed CDDA data better than any previous version =)
+
+
+CDRMooby 2.3
+
+This release is dedicated to people who understand that problems get fixed when accompanied by DETAILED EXPLANATIONS of what went wrong.  To the rest of you out there, don't complain unless you're willing to help.  By the way, it seems many of you don't know that I have a forum of my own hosted by emufanatics at http://www.emufanatics.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=29 so use it.
+
+- fixes CDDA problems.  If you still have trouble, describe the problem IN DETAIL at my forum...
+
+
+
+CDRMooby 2.2
+
+Do any of you use the Linux binaries?  I just switched to Debian and I'm much happier for doing so. However Linux binaries that use C++ libraries don't translate well across Linuxes.  In other words, this Linux binary probably won't work for everyone.  And to make things worse for you Linux users, I got rid of make and replaced it with (the much superior) Jam (http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html) to make compiling the plugin more difficult for the rest of you.  So no complaints from the peanut gallery if the Linux version doesn't work.
+
+- Added .CCD support - experimental at best, but will probably work in most cases
+- Added PCSX2 interface.  I've only tried one demo image and it worked, so consider this experimental too.
+- Added some new CDDA play modes - play one track (and stop), repeat one track, repeat all tracks - selectable in the config menu.  Choose whatever mode you prefer or is appropriate for the game.  A serious shortcoming of the PSX CD emulation is the lack of pause and changing the repeat mode.  I'm not sure if this is a BIOS function or CD hardware function or whatever, but it would be nice to fix someday...
+- New config stuff: In Windows, the configuration settings are now stored in the registry.  There's also a new key called "autorun" that, if set, the plugin will automatically use the image listed there without prompting for a file (a nice feature for you frontend people).  Also, the plugin keeps track of the last file you ran and makes that the default when starting the emulator.
+- The file chooser defaults to files that I know work well with the plugin.  There still is the *.* option available, but I suggest you don't use it.
+- Linked with FLTK 1.1.2, now with fewer bugs =)
+
+CDRMooby 2.1
+
+Because of complaints that I didn't change the version number last time, it's different now...
+
+- fixed a bug with FILE NAMES IN ALL CAPS (but why you would use them is beyond me...)
+- fixed the linux bug with windows not closing when they should
+- linked with FLTK 1.1.0 fixing various bugs, including a nasty drag-n-drop bug...
+
+
+
+CDRMooby 2.01
+
+re-linked it with the latest FLTK which fixes some bugs with the file selection.  this also includes a bug fix with linux and bz and z compressed images.
+
+
+
+CDRMooby2 - The Real Deal
+
+Yes, after a long wait, this is the full release...  New features since 1.6...
+
+Real subchannel support. Automatically detects subchannel files when they're available.  Just make sure they're in the same directory as the image and named the same.
+New GUIs, audio handling thanks to external libraries.  Use the favorites tab in the file selection window to speed up finding your images.
+CDDA Volume is now controllable from the config menu.
+Better compatability with all emus, especially CD-DA audio.
+
+that's the new stuff... otherwise, it should behave similarly (tho better) than the last version.  the rest is for those who dont have a clue what this does...
+
+THIS PLUGIN RUNS CD IMAGES, NOT CDS THEMSELVES.
+   The images MUST be in raw (2352 byte/frame) format or in one of the compressed formats - RAR (2.x only), Z.table or .bz.index (both available in the config menu)
+   When using a .CUE sheet, CD-DA is available (for games which have it)
+      - CD-DA volume is available in the config menu
+   Subchannel support using .sub (CloneCD), .sbi or .m3s (Pete's plugin)
+   Very stable and compatable
+
+BRAND NEW LOOK!!! Now uses FLTK for dialog boxes...
+   When selecting an image, you can add a directory to the favorites tab to quickly get back there in the future!
+   Volume settings are persistant from session to session.
+
+ENTIRELY REWRITTEN FROM SCRATCH!!!
+   Uses C++ for nearly everything, external libraries for guis, audio, and compression.
+   GPL'd code for anyone out there to see.
+
+For those of you who are using 1.6 or one of the beta versions, please upgrade to this version!!!
+
+If you have any questions or bugs, PLEASE let me know so I can squish them like the annoying pests they are:
+http://mooby.psxfanatics.com
+
+
+Info for building it n such...
+
+For this plugin, I used the following external libraries:
+
+   zlib v1.1.4: http://www.gzip.org/zlib/ (windows only)
+   bzlib v1.02: http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/ (windows only)
+   portaudio v18: http://www.portaudio.com/
+   fltk v1.1.0rc5: http://www.fltk.org/
+   unrarlib v.40: http://www.unrarlib.org/
+
+FYI, I include the bzlib and zlib files because I've taken out alot of unnecessary files from the distro, not because I edited them.  Well, I did change the name of the zlib compress.c file to zcompress.c, but that was it...
+
+If you're trying to build....
+
+the windows version:
+   get portaudio and fltk from the sites above and build them...  then set environment variables 'fltkdir' and 'portaudiodir' with the root directory where you put them (i.e. if the libs are in d:/fltk/libs then the env var would be d:/fltk).  it should compile fine after that...
+
+for linux:
+   build and install fltk, then build portaudio and set the path appropriately in the makefile.  if you have bzlib and zlib installed, it should compile just fine...
