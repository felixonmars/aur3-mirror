# This file contains default mount options for pcmanfm
# If mount options are already specfied for a volume in /etc/fstab, then 
# 'mount' command will be used, and it will follow /etc/fstab.
# If a volume is not defined in /etc/fstab, such as removable usb disk,
# the mount options defined in this file will be used.
# I know this sucks. Personally, I don't like to do this either.
# However, unfortunately the latest HAL forced us to do so.
