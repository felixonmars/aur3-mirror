of such charges in writing.  Without limiting the foregoing,

You and Tenable submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of Howard County, Maryland and the United 
States District Court for Maryland, Baltimore Division, for any 
question or dispute arising out of or relating to this

arising out of or related to this Agreement.

or otherwise transfer this Agreement without Tenable's prior 
written consent.  You may use the Software to provide services 
to third parties as expressly provided in this Agreement.

advertising, publicity or release without the prior written 
approval 
of Tenable, which Tenable may withhold in its sole discretion. 
17.	Language.  
The language of this Agreement is English and all notices given 
under this Agreement must be in English to be 
effective.  No translation, if any, of this Agreement or any 
notice will be of any effect in the interpretation of this 
Agreement or 
in determining the intent of the parties.  The parties have 
expressly agreed that all invoices and related documents be 
drafted in English. 
18.	Third Parties.  
This Agreement is not intended nor will it be interpreted to 
confer any benefit, right or privilege in any person or 
entity not a party to this Agreement.  Any party who is not a 
party to this Agreement has no right under any Law to enforce 
any term of this Agreement.
19.	General.  
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the 
parties, and supersedes all other prior or 
contemporaneous communications between the parties (whether 
written or oral) relating to the subject matter of this 
Agreement. No supplement, modification or amendment of this 
Agreement shall be binding, unless executed in writing by a 
duly authorized representative of each party to this Agreement.  
The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, 
and the unenforceability of any one or more provisions will not 
affect the enforceability of any other provisions.  In addition, 
if 
any provision of this Agreement, for any reason, is declared to 
be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable 
provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable 
law, preserves the original intentions and economic 
positions of the parties.  No failure or delay by a party in 
exercising any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver 
of 
that right, power or remedy, and no waiver will be effective 
unless it is in writing and signed by the waiving party.  If a 
party 
waives any right, power or remedy, the waiver will not waive any 
successive or other right, power or remedy the party may 
have under this Agreement.  Any provision of this Agreement that 
imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party 
will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.  
"Including" and its derivatives (such as "include" and 
"includes") 
mean including without limitation; this term is as defined, 
whether or not capitalized in this Agreement.
