+ * A typical Interface Descriptor for a stylus will contain a

+ *
+ * It also contains a digitizer application collection that also is not
+ * of interest since any information it contains would be duplicate
+ * of what is in wacom_features. Usually it defines a report of an array
+ * of bytes that could be used as max length of the stylus packet returned.
+ * If it happens to define a Digitizer-Stylus Physical Collection then
+ * the X and Y logical values contain valid data but it is ignored.
+ *
+ * A typical Interface Descriptor for a touch interface will contain a
+ * Digitizer-Finger Physical Collection which will define both logical
+ * X/Y maximum as well as the physical size of tablet. Since touch
+ * interfaces haven't supported pressure or distance, this is enough
+ * information to override invalid values in the wacom_features table.
