NOTICE

This file is part of a BETA-TEST version of POV-Ray version 3.7. It is not
final code. Use of this source file is governed by both the standard POV-Ray
licences referred to in the copyright header block above this notice, and the
following additional restrictions numbered 1 through 4 below:

  1. This source file may not be re-distributed without the written permission
     of Persistence of Vision Raytracer Pty. Ltd.

  2. This notice may not be altered or removed.
  
  3. Binaries generated from this source file by individuals for their own
     personal use may not be re-distributed without the written permission
     of Persistence of Vision Raytracer Pty. Ltd. Such personal-use binaries
     are not required to have a timeout, and thus permission is granted in
     these circumstances only to disable the timeout code contained within
     the beta software.
  
  4. Binaries generated from this source file for use within an organizational
     unit (such as, but not limited to, a company or university) may not be
     distributed beyond the local organizational unit in which they were made,
     unless written permission is obtained from Persistence of Vision Raytracer
     Pty. Ltd. Additionally, the timeout code implemented within the beta may
     not be disabled or otherwise bypassed in any manner.

The following text is not part of the above conditions and is provided for
informational purposes only.

The purpose of the no-redistribution clause is to attempt to keep the
circulating copies of the beta source fresh. The only authorized distribution
point for the source code is the POV-Ray website and Perforce server, where
the code will be kept up to date with recent fixes. Additionally the beta
timeout code mentioned above has been a standard part of POV-Ray betas since
version 1.0, and is intended to reduce bug reports from old betas as well as
keep any circulating beta binaries relatively fresh.

All said, however, the POV-Ray developers are open to any reasonable request
for variations to the above conditions and will consider them on a case-by-case
basis.

Additionally, the developers request your co-operation in fixing bugs and
generally improving the program. If submitting a bug-fix, please ensure that
you quote the revision number of the file shown above in the copyright header
(see the '$Revision:' field). This ensures that it is possible to determine
what specific copy of the file you are working with. The developers also would
like to make it known that until POV-Ray 3.7 is out of beta, they would prefer
to emphasize the provision of bug fixes over the addition of new features.

Persons wishing to enhance this source are requested to take the above into
account. It is also strongly suggested that such enhancements are started with
a recent copy of the source.

The source code page (see http://www.povray.org/beta/source/) sets out the
conditions under which the developers are willing to accept contributions back
into the primary source tree. Please refer to those conditions prior to making
any changes to this source, if you wish to submit those changes for inclusion
with POV-Ray.
