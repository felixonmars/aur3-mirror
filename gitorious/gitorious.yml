  # The following is annotated default settings for your Gitorious install. In
  # order for Gitorious to function properly, you _must_ tend to some of these
  # settings. The settings are presented in four groups below; the top group is
  # settings you have to provide, the second group is settings we recommend you
  # review (and change where appropriate). The third group contains settings for
  # tweaking the behavior of Gitorious (system message, public/private mode and
  # so on), while the fourth group contains entirely optional settings that you
  # can freely skip even reading when initially setting up (mostly related to
  # theming and customizing the UI).
  #
  # Note: This configuration file will be split into smaller logically grouped
  # files in future versions of Gitorious.
  #
  # If you want to be able to run Gitorious in development mode (useful when
  # developing new features, or debugging), be sure to copy all the settings
  # to the development group too. Look for the development: label to the bottom
  # of this file.
  #
  # ------------------
  # MANDATORY SETTINGS
  # ------------------
  #
  # Port the ./script/gitorious script should use. This should be the port
  # Gitorious runs under in the given environment. For normal setups, this will
  # be port 80 (in the production environment).
  gitorious_client_port: 3000

  # Host the ./script/gitorious script should use. This should be a locally
  # reachable hostname. Note that if you use Apache to serve Gitorious, you
  # have to provide 'localhost' as a ServerAlias in order for the app to be
  # reachable over localhost:80. You may also specify the public hostname
  # here, e.g. gitorious.mycompany.com.
  gitorious_client_host: localhost.localdomain

  # Host name users use to reach Gitorious, e.g. "gitorious.org".
  gitorious_host: localhost.localdomain

  # The path where git repositories are stored. The actual (bare) repositories
  # reside in #{repository_base_path}/#{project.slug}/#{repository.name}.git/:
  repository_base_path: "/usr/share/webapps/gitorious/repositories"

  # Gitorious allows users to download archived tarballs of repositories. In
  # order to do this, it needs a separate directory to do the rough work,
  # and a directory to keep cached tarballs (such that we don't waste time
  # re-generating tarballs on every request).
  #
  # Tarball cache directory. Gitorious uses X-Sendfile to deliver files to
  # users, so this needs to be readable by the web server.
  archive_cache_dir: "/usr/share/webapps/gitorious/tarballs"

  #
  # Temporary tarball work directory
  archive_work_dir: "/usr/share/webapps/gitorious/tmp"

  # Session key. It is recommended to use a long random string for this. A
  # suitable key can be generated with `apg -m 64`. Make sure you paste the
  # key as one long string, no newlines or escaped characters.
  cookie_secret: CHANGEME_SECRET

  # --------------------
  # RECOMMENDED SETTINGS
  # --------------------
  #
  # In most cases you will want to keep the following settings as is, but we
  # recommend you familiarize yourself with them. If you stray from the common
  # path during setup, you will likely have to change some settings here.

  # Use SSL? Requires web server configuration. Strongly recommended. Forces
  # the use of HTTPS on login page and all pages while user is logged in.
  use_ssl: true

  # The user that runs the poller (and, optionally, the git daemon), and who
  # owns the repositories on disk.

  # If Gitorious trips on an unrecoverable error, it will send you an email
  # with details if you provide your addresses here.

  # Messaging queue configuration
  # Gitorious ships with two message queue implementations; Stomp via the
  # ActiveMessaging gem and Resque. A TorqueBox implementation is on its way.
  # Possible values: stomp, resque, test, sync. Default value is stomp. The test
  # implementation is intended for unit testing only, not for production or
  # development use (messages are only stored in a list, never processed). The
  # sync adapter is intended for development use, but may also suit low traffic
  # setups where performance is not critical.
  messaging_adapter: stomp

  # Disable record throttling
  # By default, Gitorious throttles the rate at which users can create
  # database records (repositories, projects, messages..) Users can
  # only create X records within Y timeframe, or they'll get a "hold
  # off for a while" error message after which the offending user has
  # to wait until the Y timeframe has passed to create more records of
  # that type. Disable this only if you trust all your users not to
  # abuse/spam/DDOS your Gitorious instance with repo/msg/project creation.
  disable_record_throttling: false

  # The following properties are all defaults for the stomp adapter
  # Be sure to match thir analogues in broker.yml
  # stomp_server_address: localhost

  # stomp_server_passcode: ~

  # The maximum number of seconds to allow the web server to wait for diffs for

  # Exposes a public url at /admin/diagnostics/summary which, when
  # called, runs a number of health checks to verify that the

  # When Gitorious is running in public mode (true), everyone with access to the
  # server can view and clone repositories. Private mode (false) will not allow
  # anonymous access to content or user registration. Only pre-approved and
  # logged in users can surf the Gitorious installation.
  #
  # NB! If you intend to run in private mode, you should probably also disable
  # HTTP and git:// cloning. These protocols are anonymous, and will allow
  # unregistered users to pull repositories, given that they somehow obtained
  # the correct URLs.
  #public_mode: true

  # Enabling private repositories allows users to control read-access to their
  # repositories. Repositories are public by default, but individual users
  # and/or groups can be given read permissions to limit who can see and pull
  # from individual repositories and/or projects.

  # The following settings are useful if you're interested in theming your
  # Gitorious install. Please note however, that we don't give any API
  # guarantees for view code, controllers or CSS. In fact, we plan to ditch most
  # of the existing CSS and JavaScript and replace it with a more modular system
  # (and significantly improved) markup sometime soon-ish, so use
  # "themes"/overrides at your own risk. In particular, we will not include
  # relevant theme information in the Changelog, so you will need to refer to
  # the git log if updating gives you trouble.

  # Site name. Default is "Gitorious"
  #site_name: Gitorious

  # Additional stylesheets for most pages. "Most pages" is everything except for
  # the frontpage/public index, login page and the register page.
  #
  # One way to theme Gitorious would be to put a submodule in public/ that
  # contains stylesheets and images. Then include the following setting
  # (assuming that your submodule is at public/mytheme, and includes a directory
  # stylesheets/theme.css):
  #common_stylesheets: /mytheme/stylesheets/theme
  #
  # If you have several files:
  #common_stylesheets:
  #  - /mytheme/stylesheets/theme
  #  - /mytheme/stylesheets/theme2
  #
  # Note that the extra stylesheets will be added to the bundle used in
  # production

  # Additional stylesheets for the frontpage and login pages. Works like the
  # common_stylesheets setting
  #external_stylesheets: /mytheme/stylesheets/themed-public-index

  # Use your own favicon
  #favicon_url: http://www.mysite.com/favicon.ico

  # Logo image. If this setting is not provided, the default Gitorious logo will
  # be used. If you provide the setting, but no value, no logo image will be
  # rendered, only the text "Gitorious" (may be useful if you want to provide a
  # logo via CSS). If you provide a URL, it will be assumed to be an image and
  # included as an img tag.
  #logo_url:

  # Add more view paths if you want to override some or all of Gitorious'
  # views. Make sure you know what you're doing before attepting this - there is
  # no API guarantee from the current controllers. If you override views, study
  # the git log (the Changelog may not mention these changes) before upgrading.
  #additional_view_paths: vendor/plugin/mysite/views
  #
  # This allows you to e.g. provide your own frontpage template by saving the
  # file:
  # vendor/plugin/mysite/views/site/public_index.html.erb
  #
  # (Note that this particular template requires is_gitorious_dot_org:
  # true). Refer to app/views/site/public_index.html.erb for how to customize.

  # If your site uses other mechanisms for authentication than the built-in
  # enter a label to display next to the username field in Gitorious
  # custom_username_label: Username
