     Linux:
     * Fixed a bug which caused product registration to fail on Ubuntu
       13.04.

   CrossOver Linux 12.1.2 - 2013/03/01
     * Application Support:

     * Fixed a bug which caused Steam to get stuck in a loop while trying
       to update.
     * Fixed a bug which caused performance to suffer badly in Skyrim, and
       possibly some other games, on certain Linux systems.
     * Fixed a bug which caused Outlook 2010 to fail to open .xlsx, .pptx,
       and .docx attachments.
     * Fixed a bug which caused Quicken to fail to connect to Chase Bank

     * Office 2007 and 2010 will now display help topics!

     Mac OS X:
     * We have improvements to windowing in the Mac Driver.
     * We are hopeful that changes in this version of CrossOver will mean
       that gaming performance will improve when Apple releases its
       upcoming OS X 10.8.3.

   CrossOver Linux 12.1.1 - 2013/01/25
     * Mac OS X:

     * Resolved an issue where CrossOver would not register via a serial
       code.

   CrossOver Linux 12.1.0 - 2013/01/23
     * CrossOver:

     * CrossOver no longer ships Wine-Mono, an open-source replacement for
       .Net, by default. We had started doing this for CrossOver 12 but
       the large increase in download size and disk space usage proved too
       much. CrossOver can still download and install Wine-Mono on an
       as-needed basis.
     * We have fixed a bug which caused CrossOver to print unnecessary
       error messages when launching Windows applications, complaining
       that certain icon files could not be found.
     * New translations for Polish & Chinese (China), and a partial
       translation for Italian.

     Mac OS X:
     * We have fixed a bug where certain users who chose "Register for all
       users of this computer" during CrossOver's registration would
       receive an error claiming their bottle had "expired" and could not
       be used, despite the user having a valid valid CrossOver license.
     * We have added a preference setting allowing the user to control
       what CrossOver does with an unknown Windows .exe file when it is
       launched. Using this preference, the user can tell CrossOver either
       to treat the unknown .exe file as an application installer, or to
       simply run it.
     * CrossOver will now auto-update CrossTie files if the user has
       permitted auto-updates of CrossOver itself via Sparkle.
     * Fixed a bug which caused several games to malfunction when run in
       fullscreen mode.
     * Fixed a bug where automatic updates via Sparkle would fail for some
       users on OS X 10.6.8.
     * Fixed a bug which caused several games to fail when running in
       fullscreen mode. Games which should be improved include StarCraft,
       Fallout, and, we hope, many others.
     * Fixed a bug which prevented some users from logging into World of
       Tanks servers.

     Linux:
     * Running Guild Wars 2 on Ubuntu 12.04 with CrossOver 12 triggered a
       bug in the Compiz window manager which caused a CPU spike. We have
       added a registry key which can be used to disable the feature which
       caused Guild Wars 2 to trigger this bug, thus making the game
       playable with Compiz on Ubuntu.
     * Fixed an issue where the screen would go blank during the
       installation of some programs.

     Application Support:
     * Fixed connection errors with Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2010 when
       connecting to hosted Exchange servers.
     * Fixed a bug which caused adding a table of contents to a Microsoft
       Word document to fail.
     * Fixed an issue where Quicken failed to download WebConnect and QFX
       files.
     * Fixed an issue where Quicken crashed viewing investment details.
     * Fixed an issue where Quicken crashed when expanding columns in
       reports.
     * Fixed a bug which caused clicking on a promotional offer in Quicken
       to crash.
     * Fixed some connection failures with Quicken 2011.
     * Fixed an issue where rotated text was garbled in PowerPoint 2010.
     * Fixed a bug selecting shapes in Visio 2010.
     * Fixed a crash on launch in HCFA-1500.

   CrossOver Linux 12.0.0 - 2012/12/12
     * Mac OS X:

     * CrossOver now incorporates our experimental Mac Driver. With the
       Mac Driver, Windows programs running under CrossOver no longer have
       to use the X Window System to interact with the screen and
       keyboard. This feature is currently experimental but will become
       the way all CrossOver applications work on OS X in the future.
     * CrossOver has improved font handling for fonts used by certain
       applications, such as National Mah Jongg League Online.

     Linux:
     * CrossOver Linux now installs a single desktop menu item rather than
       a multitude of desktop menus. This approach works better with
       desktop systems such as GNOME 3 and Unity, which usually don't have
       a hierarchical desktop menu structure.
     * CrossOver now has much better support for window transparency
       (layered windows) when a compositing window manager is available.
       (When the Mac Driver is complete, this feature will be available on
       OS X as well). Many transparent windows will now work that did not
       before. Improvements in this area include:

     * Microsoft Office applications in the Office 2003 and Office 2007
       suites will now behave properly when working with embedded pictures
       or graphics. Previously, rotating or resizing embedded graphics
       caused the screen to go temporarily black;
     * Game launchers (such as that for Guild Wars 2, for example) which
       use color-keying to create transparent window areas will display
       properly rather than being drawn with black borders; ...and many
       more.

     We have resolved some issues which caused printers not to appear.

     Application Support:
     * CrossOver now supports World of Tanks.
     * CrossOver now supports Quicken 2013.
     * CrossOver now supports installation of .Net 4.0.
     * CrossOver Linux now supports Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2 will run
       for many people on CrossOver Mac, but many users will encounter
       persistent graphics problems. Previously, CodeWeavers had released
       a specially-built version of CrossOver dedicated to running Guild
       Wars 2. That is no longer necessary.
     * Improvements to Microsoft Office:

     * Fixed a crash displaying certain email messages in Outlook 2010.
     * Outlook 2010 will now save passwords.
     * Improved Gmail and other IMAP connections with Outlook 2007.
     * Fixed auto-discovery during account configuration for Outlook 2007.
     * PowerPoint 2010 now displays equations in slide shows.
     * PowerPoint 2010 no longer displays blank slides.
     * Fixed bugs in Word 2010 which caused the equation editor to be
       missing structures and formulas.
     * Fixed a bug in Word 2010 related to footnote style choices.
     * Project 2007 and 2010 can now edit dates for recurring tasks.
     * Fixed a crash in Project 2010 when filtering by resource name.
     * Visio 2002 can now search for new shapes.
     * Visio 2010 now displays properly when multiple shapes are open.

     Star Trek Online is now faster during game updates.

     Quicken 2009 no longer has garbled text on its buttons.

     An issue with installation of .Net 3.5 SP1 was resolved.

     World of Warcraft has had fixes related to patching and installation.

     CrossOver and Wine:
     * CrossOver is now based on Wine 1.5.15.
     * CrossOver's built-in web-browser will offer to download and install
       ActiveX controls.
     * CrossOver now comes bundled with the Wine-Mono package, an
       alternative implementation of the .Net API.
     * CrossOver now implements Raw Input, the set of APIs used for mouse
       input by games like Guild Wars 2, World of Tanks, and others.
     * Support for printing on a variety of paper sizes has been improved.
     * DirectSound has a new resampler, for higher quality audio.
     * CrossOver now has sub-pixel font anti-aliasing.

   CrossOver Linux 11.3.1 - 2012/11/05
     * Mac OS X:

     * - Complete translations for:

     * Czech,
     * Spanish,
     * Japanese,
     * Polish,
     * Portuguese (Brazil), and
     * Chinese (China).

     Fix for font rendering in Civilization IV.

     Linux:
     * - Complete translations for:

     * Czech,
     * Spanish,
     * Japanese,
     * Lithuanian,
     * Polish,
     * Portuguese (Brazil),
     * Swedish, and
     * Chinese (China).

     Fix a bug on Ubuntu 12.04 where Excel files would fail to launch.

     Note: to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users: CrossOver 11.3.0 is the
   last version of CrossOver which will work with RHEL5. The X11 libraries
   in RHEL5 are sufficiently old that future versions of CrossOver will
   not work in RHEL5. An upgrade to RHEL6 or newer will be necessary to
   use future versions of CrossOver. CrossOver Linux 11.2.2 - 2012/09/21
     * Mac OS X bug fix (no Linux release):

     * This release fixes a bug which caused applications doing 3D drawing
       to fail to launch on Mac OS X 10.8.2 and 10.7.5. Because of this
       failure, many games, and some other applications, would not run
       using CrossOver on OS X 10.8.2 and 10.7.5.

   CrossOver Linux 11.2.1 - 2012/08/27
     * CrossTie Updates:

     * This release updates several CrossTie installation recipes to avoid

       filenames.

     Linux:
     * Fedora 17 improvements, including:

     * Support for UDisks 2; and
     * The CrossOver installer will now detect whether perl is present
       prior to install. (CrossOver requires perl, and Fedora 17 does not
       include it by default).

     Better detection of correct libpng versions on some distributions,
   including Arch Linux.

     Fixed an error uninstalling packages from the Ubuntu Software Center,
   as well as custom packages built with cxrepackage.

     Suggest zypper package manager on SUSE Linux (instead of yast).

     * Fixed an error where Internet Explorer 6 in a Win98 bottle would
       complain it was not registered.
     * Fixed an error which would cause CrossOver's 'Welcome' screen to
       not appear in some situations on Mac OS X Lion.
     * Fixed a problem which caused Windows applications to have slightly
       (four) fewer graphics shaders available than they could have, which
       could produce graphics glitches in games.

     * Fixes for (we hope!) the last outstanding problems with CrossOver
       registration / licensing.
     * Improvements to Japanese and Russian translations.

   CrossOver Linux 11.0.2 - 2012/03/20
     * Bug-fix release only:

     * 11.0.1 exhibited a bug whereby it would be in trial mode for some
       users who were entitled to a licensed version. 11.0.2 was a bug-fix
       release for that problem only.

   CrossOver Linux 11.0.1 2012/03/20
     * CrossOver Mac:

     * Crucial fix to registration: it would fail for users who selected
       'Register for all users of this computer', causing CrossOver to
       expire after the demo period. Note that single-user registration
       was unaffected.

     CrossOver Linux:
     * Fixes to registration from behind a proxy on systems using
       GNOME/GConf (CrossOver would sometimes detect stale proxy

     * Improved naming conventions for bottles.
     * Improved handling for published bottles.

     A wide variety of other improvements brought by the more than 11,438
   improvements to Wine with this release.

     Other CrossOver Changes:
     * Improvements to the icon extraction for Windows applications,
       meaning fewer apps get a default 'fallback' icon (like the Wine
       bottle which used to appear for some things).
     * Distribution on the Mac is now via a zip file rather than a dmg.
     * CrossOver on the Mac will now offer to move itself to the
       /Applications folder if it is not already there.
     * CrossOver Mac now ships with quartz-wm, so users should not have to
       install Apple's X11.app in most cases. (quartz-wm also fixes some

     * CrossOver on Mac OS X now has user-controlled auto-updates.
     * CrossOver on Linux has higher resolution icons for some
       applications.

       and 2.x instead of crashing.
     * Bidi (right to left text) support is greatly improved.
     * Added support for RAR file handling.
     * CrossOver is no longer confused by spaces in the name of an
       installer.

       of the disk.
     * Documented sound workarounds for older versions of PulseAudio.

       a particular application was last 'ranked' with a medal.

     Application Support:

       CrossOver now supports both all the applications which previously
       ran under CrossOver Pro and all the games which previously ran
       under CrossOver Games.

   CrossOver Linux 6.0.0 - 2007/01/08
     * Application fixes:

     * Added support for Flash Player 9.
     * Major improvements in Outlook behavior; except for composing HTML
       mail, it seems to perform basic functions well (and installing Word
       or IE will make HTML composition work).

       installed in a Windows 98 bottle, it should work much better than
       it did before.
     * Improved installation of Quicken. All versions but Quicken 2007
       should be usable now. Quicken 2007 is partially usable but has some

     * Fix the 'no-execute' and SELinux compatibility issues that happen
       on recent Fedora Core 4 and Fedora Core 5 distributions.
     * If ClamAV is installed, then CrossOver's wine script will now scan
       executables and attachments before running them. This should not be
       seen as an ironclad antivirus shield but as one more step to
       prevent accidental infection through CrossOver's associations.
     * Make it possible to upgrade bottle RPMs. Many other bottle RPM
       fixes and improvements.
     * Added support for repackaging an existing CrossOver installation as
       an RPM for distributing site-specific customizations.

       Music Store again.
     * Work around an Internet Explorer 6 installer bug which causes it to
       complain about the 'download information' being 'damaged',

     * Added Netscape plugin support (but only on the server, not on the
       clients).

     Desktop menu fixes:
     * Work around a KDE 3.5.1 bug so the 'Windows Applications' menu is
       visible on SUSE 10.1.
     * Work around a KDE 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 bug so the CrossOver associations
       appear in the 'Open with...' list. This fixes recent Fedora Core 5
       versions, SUSE 10.1 and Ubuntu 6.06.
     * Work around a Mandriva 2006.0 bug so '&' and ';' won't break all
       the menus.
     * Fix menu duplication issue for root installs on Mandriva 2006.0.
     * Fix menu duplication issue on Debian 3.1, Mandrake 10.1 and others.
     * Fix menus on SUSE 9.0.

       Desktop' icon.
     * Fix handling of KDE's desktop icons for root installs.
     * Improve handling of the Windows 2000 menus. Installing an
       unsupported application in a Windows 2000 bottle should now always
       result in the creation of the corresponding menus.

     Desktop association fixes:
     * Make associations work with email tools that create temporary files
       with no extension. Strictly check the extension against the
       association's MIME type.
     * Fixed XDG associations so that they now work with Evolution.
     * Work around a Mozilla bug to make the associations work again in
       that browser.
     * More Excel association fixes.
     * Add aliases for the PowerPoint MIME types. This should stop
       PowerPoint associations from being ignored on some systems.
     * Ignore bad MIME types used by some Windows applications so their
       associations can be exported anyway.
     * Fix a bug which caused garbage to be put in the description of a
       couple of rarely used Internet Explorer MIME types.
     * Rename 'alternate associations' to 'alternative associations' for
       more clarity.

     General CrossOver fixes:
     * The CrossOver RPM packages now minimize the 'rpm --verify' output
       and correctly identify documentation files.
     * Fixed some issues with spaces in the bottle names, especially with
       managed bottles.
     * Improved the default browser detection in GNOME and KDE.
     * Improved the Windows Application CD detection.
     * Improved cxreset so it catches all hung Wine processes.
     * Improved support for CD-ROMs that are auto-mounted by means of
       Supermount (Mandriva), Subfs (SUSE) or HAL (recent distributions).
       In practice this means CrossOver Setup should no longer get into a
       loop trying to fix your CD-ROM configuration over and over again.
     * Made it easier to install multi-CD applications on Supermount
       systems.
     * Improved CrossOver's cxsu tool which is used to run commands as
       root so it automatically knows when to use sudo (e.g. on Ubuntu)
       and when to use su.
     * Fix the conversion of icons to PNG format. This should avoid some
       xpmtoppm error messages.

       included during custom installation of Microsoft Office 2000 and
       XP.
     * Fixed installation of the Office 2003 spellchecker and equation
       editor.
     * Fixed the Lotus Notes minimization bug that cause Notes windows to
       bounce back after being minimized.

       displayed.

     * Improved Debian package support.

     * Major improvements in installer technology so that most
       applications should now install with CrossOver.
     * Support for virtual Windows environments running either in
       traditional Windows 98 compatibility or for environments supporting
       Windows 2000/XP.
     * 'Bottle Manager' - the ability to manage multiple simultaneous
       virtual Windows environments simply and easily. This allows you to
       segregate applications into different environments (aka 'bottles')
       to simplify testing and to improve stability. Bottles can be backed
       up, archived, and restored, and bottles can be deployed via RPM,
       making the process of deploying a Windows application as simple as
       pushing an RPM around.
     * Plugin support for 64-bit browsers.

     New Technical Details (since 4.2):
     * Major changes in the underlying Wine technology base which should

       window managers; odd flickers and painting issues should be greatly
       reduced. COM / MSI implementation, which now enables CrossOver to

     * Many, many other improvements.

     * Made Remedy usable.

       Linux users.
     * The Standard and Pro editions now include support for the Netscape
       plugins which was previously only present in CrossOver Plugin. Now
       a single CrossOver installation can handle all your needs!
     * Improved localization: now all of the application interface,
       including the desktop menus and scripts can be localized.
     * A complete translation to French is provided.
     * Improved internationalization support: CrossOver Setup should now
       correctly list applications that use non-ASCII characters. The
       application menus should also be created with the right character
       encoding.
     * Made it possible to switch from the demo to the full version
       without reinstalling.
     * Added a tool to capture the system configuration. This should help
       us better diagnose issues.
     * Systematically log a trace of the Windows application installations
       to help diagnosis in case of a problem. The size of this log is
       capped so it cannot fill the disk.
     * General bug fixes:

     * Sound should now work on i810-based sound cards, provided that you
       configure CrossOver to use the winealsa sound driver.
     * The cxuninstall script now offers to clean up the CrossOver
       environment when run by a non-root user in private or managed
       multi-user mode. It will also remind you of all the steps to take
       to fully uninstall CrossOver in these modes.
     * The cxuninstall script now also works for RPM and Debian
       installations.
     * The old Loki uninstaller does not work on new Linux distributions.

       smoothly.

     * Support for all known versions of glibc, including the new Native
       POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) interface. This represents a major
       technical advance for Wine, as glibc instability has been a problem
       throughout 2003.
     * Support for the Dreamweaver MX Studio.
     * Support for Minitab 13, Geometer Sketchpad, and Scientific Word.

       system tray integration does not work).
     * A modest boost in performance in creating menus.

       installation of Visio Enterprise edition.
     * Critical installation bug fix: prevent older installers from

     * Improved on-screen font rendering, especially in small types. Our
       internal FreeType library now includes Apple's patented hinting
       technology so that fonts will render as cleanly and crisply as on
       Windows.

     Detect and setup CD drives, including multi-CD configurations.

     Detect and optionally fix fstab CD drive entries that do not include
