[CrossOver]

;;-----------------< Basic Settings >-----------------------------------
;;
;; PreferredBrowser     Specifies the browser command that CrossOver
;;                      should use when asked to open a URL. The
;;                      default is to try to automatically pick the
;;                      most appropriate browser.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with
;;                      the syntax '${VARNAME}'. Note that only simple
;;                      commands are supported. In particular
;;                      backquotes and semi-colons have no special
;;                      meaning.
;;
;;                      Default:    "" (auto-detect)
;;
;; ManagedShortcutDirs  Specifies a colon-separated list of directories
;;                      where managed bottles should create scripts to
;;                      start Windows applications.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with
;;                      the syntax '${VARNAME}'.

;;                      where private bottles should create scripts to

;;                      must be writable by non-root users and thus
;;                      should probably be relative to '${HOME}'.

;;
;; MenuIgnoreList       This is a colon-separated list of menuing system
;;                      IDs. It specifies menuing systems which should
;;                      be ignored when creating and deleting menus.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; AssocIgnoreList      This is a colon-separated list of association

;;                      deleting associations.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; MIMEIgnoreList       A colon-separated list of MIME Types to ignore.
;;                      You can use this to prevent CrossOver Setup
;;                      from ever associating these MIME types to a
;;                      Windows application.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; ExtIgnoreList        A colon-separated list of extensions to ignore
;;                      when scanning the Windows associations. The
;;                      leading dot of the extension should be omitted
;;                      and regular expressions are allowed.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""

;; ManagedLinuxNSPluginDirs
;; ManagedLinux64NSPluginDirs
;;                      Specifies a colon-separated list of directories

;; PrivateLinux64NSPluginDirs
;;                      Specifies a colon-separated list of directories

;; CreateNSPluginDirs   If a directory mentioned in one of the other

;;                      present in this colon-separated list of
;;                      directories, then an attempt to create it will
;;                      be made.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with
;;                      the syntax '${VARNAME}'.
;;
;;                      Default:    ""
;;
;; AntiVirusScan        When to scan for viruses. If set to 'never',
;;                      then no scan is ever done. If set to
;;                      'untrusted', then only untrusted files are
;;                      scanned. If set to 'start', then files are
;;                      scanned before they are run by the wine script.
;;
;;                      Note that there is no way to have all files be
;;                      scanned before they are opened by Windows
;;                      applications, for instance when one uses the
;;                      File -> Open dialog.
;;
;;                      Default:    start
;;
;; AntiVirusCommand     The command to use to scan for viruses in
;;                      Windows applications and files.
;;                      The default is to auto-detect Clam AntiVirus,
;;                      Avast Antivirus, AVG Anti-Virus, McAfee
;;                      LinuxShield, F-Prot Antivirus, AntiVir
;;                      Workstation and the Sophos Anti-virus,
;;                      and uses the first one found.
;;                      This setting can use environment variables with
;;                      the syntax '${VARNAME}'. Note that only simple
;;                      commands are supported. In particular
;;                      backquotes and semi-colons have no special
;;                      meaning.
;;
;;                      Default:    auto-detect
;;
;; AntiVirusClean       A regular expression to apply to the hexadecimal
;;                      scanner exit code to identify when it determined
;;                      that the file is clean. So for instance "(0|13)"
;;                      would mean that the virus scanner returns 0 or
;;                      19 ('13' in hexadecimal) for clean files.
;;
;;                      Default:    Automatically set for supported
;;                                  virus scanners, "0" otherwise.
;;
;; AntiVirusMatch       A regular expression to apply to the hexadecimal
;;                      scanner exit code to identify when it determined
;;                      that the file is infected. So for instance "[cd]"
;;                      would mean that the virus scanner returns 12
;;                      ('c' in hexadecimal) or 13 ('d') when it detects
;;                      a virus.
;;                      Any exit code that matches neither AntiVirusMatch
;;                      nor AntiVirusClean indicates a scanner
;;                      malfunction.
;;
;;                      Default:    Automatically set for supported
;;                                  virus scanners, "1" otherwise.
;;
;; ReportWineUsage      If set to 1, then the wine script will
;;                      record usage data and CrossOver will
;;                      periodically upload that data to a server.
;;                      If set to 0, then no usage will be recorded.
;;                      If empty, CrossOver will periodically ask the
;;                      user to opt in.
