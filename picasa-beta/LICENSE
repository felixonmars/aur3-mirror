 Automatic Updates
 
 The Picasa Software may communicate with Google's servers to check for 
available updates to the Picasa Software, such as bug fixes, patches, 
enhanced functions, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, 
"Updates").  During this process, the Picasa Software creates a randomly 
generated number for updating the software, which is not associated with 
any personally identifying information.  The Picasa Software sends 
Google a request for the latest Picasa Software version information.  If 
a newer version is available, the Picasa Software will give you the 
option of downloading it. The Picasa Software asks for permission before 
downloading an updated version.  If you wish to disable the automated 
check for updates, please see the FAQ 
[http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=11249] for 
details. By installing the Picasa Software and not disabling the 
automated check for Updates, you hereby agree to automatically request 
and receive Updates from Google's servers.
