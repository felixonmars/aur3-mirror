# Example plugin build time configuration
#
# This file lists the configuration options that are used when building the
# antispam plugin. All lines starting with # are ignored. Configuration option
# lines must be commented out completely, if they are not to be included,
# i.e. just setting VARIABLE=n is not disabling that variable.
#
# This file is included in Makefile, so variables like CFLAGS and LIBS can also
# be modified from here. In most cases, these lines should use += in order not
# to override previous values of the variables.

# backend (select exactly one)
#  dspam-exec		- direct dspam training by calling dspam executable
#  signature-log	- signature logging using dovecot's dict API
#  mailtrain		- send mail to special addresses for training
#  crm114-exec		- direct crm114 training by calling mailreaver.crm
#  spool2dir		- spool trained emails to a directory

# Dovecot build/header directory
# Building the plugin requires configured dovecot sources or having
# configured it with --enable-header-install in which case you can
# point DOVECOT= to the installed headers too.

# The user and group for the installed plugin
USER=root
GROUP=root

# enable debugging to syslog or stderr
#DEBUG=stderr
#DEBUG=syslog

# verbose debugging (lots of output!)

# plugin name, change only if you need to rename the plugin
# (because, for example, you need two instances for different
# spam filters installed)
