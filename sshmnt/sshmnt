# --------------------------------------------------- #
# sshmnt is a script used with sshfs and fuse to help #
# manage multiple ssh based network-filesystem        #
# profiles and to help organize + simplify mounting   #
# and unmounting.                                     #

# If you find this script useful but have ideas about #
# how to make it better, found bugs, need help using  #
# it or anything else; feel free to contect me. I     #
# wrote it because I wanted something that would      #
# manage ssh mounts, but do it in more of an 'arch    #
# way' than whats currently out there; however, I     #
# know there's room for improvement and I'd love to   #
# hear some input as to any directions people would   #
# like to see this take :)                            #
