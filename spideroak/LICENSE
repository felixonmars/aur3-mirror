SERVICE AGREEMENT

Last updated: June 23, 2009

This Services Agreement ("Agreement") governs the provision by SpiderOak, Inc.
("SpiderOak") and the access and use by you, its customer ("you" or "Customer")
of SpiderOak's data storage services ("Services"). BY CLICKING ON "I ACCEPT"
BELOW OR OTHERWISE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE HAVING REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED THE FOLLOWING
TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU
SHOULD NOT BEGIN USE OF YOUR ACCOUNT OR SPIDEROAK'S SERVICES, AND YOU SHOULD
IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY SPIDEROAK.

Services. You will be required to download the SpiderOak software onto your
computer and select the data you wish to backup ("Selected Data"); thereafter,
the SpiderOak software will automatically backup any revisions or modifications
that you make to the Selected Data given the application is running. Once the
Selected Data is backed up you will be able to access and share your personal
Selected Data as discussed more fully below. Additionally, you may add any
number of computers to your SpiderOak Network providing a secure central
location to store all of your data.

SpiderOak offers two levels of Services: (i) SpiderOak Free and (ii) SpiderOak
Plus. The SpiderOak Free service provides customers with a limited amount of
storage space as specified at https://spideroak.com/pricing. You may upgrade to
the SpiderOak Plus service which provides Customers with an increased amount of
storage space for a monthly fee at the rate currently listed on the SpiderOak
website https://spideroak.com/pricing. The Selected Data is stored redundantly;
however, in rare instances you may not be able to gain access to your Selected
Data during scheduled maintenance or other force majeure occurrences.

Data Protection and Encryption. SpiderOak understands the critical importance of
security and privacy and has taken extraordinary measures to protect your
Selected Data. When you register for the Services you will choose a personal
login ("Username") and private encrypted password ("Password") Your Username and
Password are required to access your Selected in a readable format. Further, to
ensure complete privacy and security, your Password is NEVER stored or known by
SpiderOak. Thus, it is extremely important to remember your Password as
SpiderOak will not be able to reset your Password or provide access to your
Selected Data should you forget it. You may change your password at any time by
opening the 'ACCOUNT' page in the application. Upon registration, you will also
be prompted to create an optional password hint ("Password Hint"). The Password
Hint is designed to provide you with enough information to recall your password
should you forget it. SpiderOak will store the Password Hint encrypted and only
provide it back to the e-mail address entered on your account at the time of
registration. You can retrieve your Password Hint anytime on the SpiderOak
website by clicking on the link "FORGOT YOUR PASSWORD?".

Sharing of Selected Data. As part of the functionality of our Services, you will
be able to share your Selected Data with others ("Sharing Function") subject to
the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree and
understand that the Sharing Function is meant for your personal use only and is
not intended for widespread dissemination of your Selected Data. SpiderOak
reserves the right to monitor general system usage and performance to identify
excessive use of the Sharing Function. The Sharing Function may be deemed
excessive if the network traffic greatly exceeds the average usage of the
services by customers generally. This safeguard is in place to protect against
egregious use of SpiderOak ShareRooms as massive content distribution channels.

Terms of Service. You agree that SpiderOak reserves the right in its sole
discretion to establish general operating practices and procedures to maximize
the operation and availability of the Services for the greatest benefit of its
customers.

If, in using the SpiderOak Free service you are deemed to have violated the
policies set forth in this Agreement, SpiderOak reserves the right to freeze,
cancel and/or purge your account with or without notice. By registering for the
SpiderOak Free Service, you acknowledge and agree that your Selected Data may
not be available at certain intervals in order for SpiderOak to perform
performance maintenance on its servers, or other reasons beyond the control of
SpiderOak.

You may at any point upgrade to the SpiderOak Plus Service. If, in using the
SpiderOak Plus service you are deemed to have violated the policies set forth
above in this Agreement, SpiderOak reserves the right to freeze your account
immediately, and shall provide you with written notice via email of your
violation so that you may respond to such determination within thirty (30) days.
If no response is received by SpiderOak within thirty (30) days of sending you
notice of the violation, SpiderOak reserves the right to cancel your membership.
Upon deciding to cancel your membership pursuant to this Section, SpiderOak
shall provide you with written notice via email of such cancellation and shall
continue to store your Selected Data for a period of sixty (60) days from the
date notice of cancellation is sent, after which time your Selected Data shall
be purged from the system.

Registration. In order to access the Service, you must complete the registration
process and obtain your personal Username and Password. In connection with your
registration, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete
information about yourself as prompted by the registration form; and (b)
maintain and promptly update such information to keep it true, accurate, current
and complete. In addition, you may only register for one SpiderOak Free account.
If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or
incomplete, or if you register for more than one SpiderOak Free account,
SpiderOak has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and
all current and future use of the Services. In addition, SpiderOak reserves the
right to deny registration to any customer it deems inappropriate to use the
Services. You may not register for the Service if you are under 14 years of age.
By registering for the Services, you represent to SpiderOak that you are 14
years of age or older, and hereby agree to be legally bound by this Agreement
(or, if you are under the age of majority in your state (usually 18), you
represent that your parent or legal guardian is hereby agreeing on your behalf
to be legally bound by this Agreement).

You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your
Username and Password and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities
and losses, you or SpiderOak may suffer as a result of your failure to do so.
Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur
under your Username and Password, including any charges for additional storage
space, etc., or other charges associated with your account, and for ensuring
that use of your account complies fully with this Agreement. You agree to
immediately notify SpiderOak of any unauthorized use of your account or any
other breach of security. You may not use anyone else's account, at any time,
without the permission of the account holder.

Payment; Renewal Notices. To the extent applicable, all payments shall be made
in US dollars by credit card and are non-refundable. Payments are due upon
account activation and future renewal dates. Services will not be activated
until payment is received. Service for any renewal period will not be provided
unless and until SpiderOak has received payment for such renewal period. Renewal
payments shall be automatically charged to your credit card and your account
shall automatically renew unless you provide SpiderOak with notice of
termination pursuant to the terms set forth below. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, should payment in full of any amount owed to SpiderOak under this
Agreement not be received by SpiderOak within thirty (30) days after such
payment has become due, such amounts will thereafter bear interest at the rate
of 1.5% per month, or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is
less. If any payment due SpiderOak is collected at law or through an attorney at
law or under advice therefrom or through a collection agency, you agree to pay
all costs of collection, including, without limitation, all court costs and
reasonable attorneys' fees. Access and use of SpiderOak Free is provided, in
part, to allow you an opportunity to use the Service on a trial basis before
signing up for SpiderOak Plus and making payment. Accordingly, SpiderOak will
not make any refunds of any payments made by you. If you are concerned about
whether you will like the Service, please use SpiderOak Free to confirm your
satisfaction prior to signing up for SpiderOak Plus.

non-transferable license to use the Services solely for your own internal
purposes. Any software provided to you as part of the Services shall be subject
to a separate end user agreement. All rights not expressly granted by SpiderOak
to you are hereby retained by SpiderOak.
